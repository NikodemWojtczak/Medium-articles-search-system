Check-mark State Recognition will take NLP projects to the next level!

Check-mark state detection from scanned images and further analysis on them can add meaningful features to NLP projects Mataprasad Agrawal · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Jan 26, 2019 -- 6 Listen Share

There are numerous business transactions where paper documents are still used as primary data exchange.

For example,

paper questionnaires or surveys having objective type of questions to answer or,

insurance claim documents

international trade finance or bank documents, where carrier’s carry importer/exporter’s documents which are further digitized using scanners as images or PDF files.

The scanned images are either loaded as is or transformed using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques to get the text content. However, HTML elements like tables, check-boxes, logos, radio buttons, and handwritten texts are lost in OCR conversion.

Capturing these elements has some useful applications and there is a way to capture them.

There are many Optical Mark Recognition(OMR) tools, open source as well as paid which can extract such elements. However, these tools require defining an area to capture in a form or template.

Of course, this is a design-time change i.e. if the template or document structure changes (which is likely), then propagation of template change right from design stage to production can be very lengthy and frustrating.

We faced similar problem recently in our project and this post talks about the approach taken and the technical details.
