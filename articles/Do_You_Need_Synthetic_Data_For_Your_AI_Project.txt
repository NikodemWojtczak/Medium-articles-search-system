Data is an issue in most AI projects. I have failed several projects due to the lack of good data… Since then, I relied way more on a relatively new approach called synthetic data. I hope that this article will help you better understand how synthetic data can help you with your AI projects.

For large tech firms like Google, Apple, and Amazon, gathering data is less of an issue compared to other companies. Indeed, they have an almost limitless supply of diverse data streams through their products/services, creating the perfect ecosystem for data scientists to train their algorithms. For smaller companies, access to these datasets is limited, expensive, or non-existent.

In addition to solving AI’s data collection problem, businesses must also contend with intense competition.

The reality is that the cost of data acquisition is high, and it keeps many from even starting. However, synthetic data can help change this situation. Synthetically generated data can help companies and researchers build data repositories needed to train and even pre-train machine learning models.

New Products, New Markets

By helping solve the data issue in AI, synthetic data technology has the potential to create new product categories and open new markets rather than merely optimize existing business lines.

This has implications for data science across an important number of industries. Besides enabling work to begin, synthetic data will allow data scientists to continue ongoing work without involving real/sensitive data.

Indeed, companies can now take their data warehouses or databases and create synthetic versions of them, without breaching the privacy of their users.

Creating Fake Data

Synthetic data is data that is generated programmatically. For example, realistic images of objects in arbitrary scenes rendered using video game engines or audio generated by a speech synthesis model from known text. It is important to say that it is not unlike traditional data augmentation where crops, flips, rotations, and distortions are used to increase the variety of data that models have to learn from.
