CycleGANs to Create Computer-Generated Art

CycleGANs refer to a subset of GANs which are capable of taking an image and generating a new image reflecting some type of transformation. The cool part of CycleGANs is you do not need paired images. This is really useful for scenarios where you may not have paired images. For example, if you want to convert pictures of zebras into pictures of horses. This kind of data would probably be impossible to collect, unless I guess if you painted zebras and horses… With enough creativity, they also turn out to be useful for creating computer-generated art that actually looks quite good!

This figure is taken from the original CycleGAN paper.

Here, I will give an overview on exactly how CycleGANs work. This post does assume that you have at least some familiarity with GANs. So if you are not familiar with GANs, check out my blog post “Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Beginners: Generating Images of Distracted Drivers.”

For this post, I use an example CycleGAN that was trained to convert pictures of forests into abstract paintings of forests. My code used to generate these images can be found on my GitHub.

The Dataset

Here, the dataset consisted of forest images and abstract paintings. I scraped these images from Google Images using the keywords “forest” and “famous abstract paintings.” To do this I used the Python package Google Images Download. A couple examples are below.

The Model

When training a CycleGAN there are four neural networks that need to be trained:
