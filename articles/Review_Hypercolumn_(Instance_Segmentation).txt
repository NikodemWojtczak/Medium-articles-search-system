Review: Hypercolumn (Instance Segmentation)

In this story, Hypercolumn is reviewed. The term “Hypercolumn”, borrowed from neuroscience, to describe a set of V1 neurons sensitive to edges at multiple orientations and multiple frequencies arranged in a columnar structure. By borrowing the idea of Hypercolumn, it boosts the prediction accuracy and it is published in 2015 CVPR with over 800 citations. When it was published in CVPR, the first author, Dr. Bharath Hariharan, was studying PhD in University of California Berkeley. When Hypercolumn was later on extended to 2017 TPAMI, Dr. Hariharan had become the Postdoctoral Researcher at Facebook AI Research (FAIR). After that, another famous paper, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is published in 2017 CVPR. Right now, he becomes assistant professor in Cornell University and is working on computer vision in 3D space. (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)
