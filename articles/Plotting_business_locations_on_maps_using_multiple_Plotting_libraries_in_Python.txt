I was browsing through Kaggle and came across a dataset which included locations in latitudes and longitudes. I haven’t worked with plotting on maps so I decided to take this dataset and explore various options available to work through them. This is a basic guide about what I did and the inferences I drew about those libraries.

The aim was to look for a library that was very easy to use and worked seamlessly out of the box for plotting on maps. Another aim was to find a library that could print all the points in the dataset at once (190,000+ points).

Here, I explored four libraries, gmplot , geopandas , plotly and bokeh . I’ll import the libraries as and when needed rather than importing them all in the beginning. The complete code is available as a GitHub repo:

Let’s begin!!

Dataset

I took the dataset from Kaggle and saved it inside the data folder as dataset.csv . It includes a list of businesses complete with their address, state, location and more. I extracted the latitude, longitude, state, unique_states and name in separate arrays. I also extracted the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude values which would help me zoom into the specific area on a world map which we’ll see below.

For each library, I’ll plot the first 1000 locations and then try to plot all the points.

gmplot

gmplot is a library that generates the plot by creating an html file which we can load in our browser. It is one of the easiest and quickest way of getting started with plotting the data on a map. It plots the information on Google Maps and hence looks really nice.
