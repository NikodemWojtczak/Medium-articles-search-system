Member-only story Is Your Company Truly Data Driven?

Every company claims to be data driven these days, but what does that actually entail?

This is a critical question to answer, both for investors choosing where to place their bets and for data scientists looking for the right company to work for. From an investorâ€™s perspective, I want to invest in companies that know what to measure, how to measure it, and actually use data to drive sound decision making. As a data scientist, I want to work for a company that has interesting data, invests time and resources into machine learning models, and has a management team that listens to data driven recommendations.

In this post, I attempt to lay out a checklist for deciding whether a company is actually data driven or just pretending to be.
