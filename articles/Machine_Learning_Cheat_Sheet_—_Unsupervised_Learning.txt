This is a summary of the unsupervised learning techniques, it mainly discusses and compares the differences for different clustering methodologies.

K-Means Clustering

Assign: set K centroids randomly, assign each point to a centroid which is closest to the point Optimize: moving the centroids to optimize the distances that are assigned to them Repeat step 1 and 2: reassign the points to the centroids, and re-optimize

Disadvantages:

Getting 3 Clusters But in Local Minimum

Local Minimum — We can run the K-Means clustering multiple times with different initial conditions to find the best output. Sensitive to noise and outliers

Choosing K

Elbow Method: Plot the ascending values of k versus the total error calculated using that k, to find the minimum total error. Average Silhouette Method: Plot the ascending values of k versus the average silhouette (average distance between points in the same cluster)using that k, to find the maximum average silhouette.

Hierarchical Clustering

Single-Link Clustering
