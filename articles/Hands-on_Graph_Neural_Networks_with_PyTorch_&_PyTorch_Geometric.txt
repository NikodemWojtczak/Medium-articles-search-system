In my last article, I introduced the concept of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and some recent advancements of it. Since this topic is getting seriously hyped up, I decided to make this tutorial on how to easily implement your Graph Neural Network in your project. You will learn how to construct your own GNN with PyTorch Geometric, and how to use GNN to solve a real-world problem (Recsys Challenge 2015).

In this blog post, we will be using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric (PyG), a Graph Neural Network framework built on top of PyTorch that runs blazingly fast. It is several times faster than the most well-known GNN framework, DGL.

Aside from its remarkable speed, PyG comes with a collection of well-implemented GNN models illustrated in various papers. Therefore, it would be very handy to reproduce the experiments with PyG.
