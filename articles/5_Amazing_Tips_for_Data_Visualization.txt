Is there a such thing as data visualization block for analysts? Like a painter who stares at a blank canvas or a writer who can’t write that first sentence — you might be an analyst just staring at a wall of data in Excel.

Or maybe you just feel like an old dog that wants to learn a new trick?

This list contains my 5 favorite techniques for consistently pumping out effective data visualizations. It also helps prevent this dreaded data visualization block. Goodbye wall of data… hello insight!

Scatter plot your two most interesting metrics

While reviewing a new dashboard for a stakeholder, we got a comment that really got me thinking. They said, “This is great in describing exactly what happened, but there is not much insight for taking action.”

In Business Intelligence, it is often much easier to visualize what happened rather than visualizing actionable insights.

This is where the scatter plot comes in.

Scatter plots are famously used to assess correlation between two metrics. Often overlooked, they actually have another use case. This variation is often referred to as a quadrant plot.

First, identify two important or interesting metrics. Second, have at least one dimension that you can take action with such as state, employees, or marketing campaigns. Then scatter away!

For example, in marketing, we often care about two metrics. Marketing performance in efficiency (acquiring as many customers as possible at a low marketing spend). Marketing performance in quality (acquiring customers that are high value).

When we scatter these two metrics by campaign we can quickly and clearly see the good and the bad.

The action from this scatter plot is to take money away from campaign E and J and put it towards D and H. This works so well because it sorts your dimension into four easy to understand quadrants.
