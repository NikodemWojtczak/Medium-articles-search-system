A few years ago I did my first freelance gig in statistics for a company in the supply chain of fruit and vegetables. 24 hours a day, incoming products from farmers underwent quality control before being sent onwards to supermarkets, based on random sampling by quality controllers.

In the year over year quality report comparison, they noticed less quality this year than the previous year, something in the order of half a point on a 1 to 10 scale.

Then I came in and the question for me to answer was:

Is a difference of 0.5 a real difference?

Without any statistical background, this question may seem weird. But don’t worry: the goal of this article is to show you how this question can be answered using hypothesis testing, also called statistical inference.

It’s a numbers game: the impact of 1 different apple

Imagine you’re checking whether an apple is good or bad, using a random selection of apples from a very large box of apples.

In the below image, we see a clear effect of sample size on the measurements: the effect of one different apple is very large for small samples and the effect of 1 apple becomes smaller and smaller the larger our sample becomes.

The impact of 1 different apple depends on the sample size

Understanding the effect of sample size is the first basis towards an understanding of Hypothesis Testing. We could start arguing that 0.5 on 2 apples, would be a 1 apple difference: very likely to happen. But on 100 apples, 0.5 would represent a 50 apple difference: an extremely strong difference!

On a small sample, 0.5 is not a big difference, but on a large sample 0.5 is a big difference.

How large should the sample be: Hypothesis Testing and significance as an answer

There are different ways to approach this question, but in this article, I am going into statistical inference, or hypothesis testing to solve this question.

Hypothesis Testing is a family of statistical methods used to identify whether a sample of…
