Simply put

The goal of this project is to build a web scraper that will run and perform searches on flight prices with flexible dates (up to 3 days before and after the dates you select first), for a particular destination. It saves an excel with the results and sends an email with the quick stats. Obviously, the objective is to help us find the best deals!

If you get lost in some part, try to have a look at my article about the Instagram bot, as it uses Selenium too.

The real life application for this is up to you. I’ve used it to search both holidays and recently also some short trips to my hometown!

If you’re serious about it, you can run the script on a server (a simple Raspberry Pi will do), and make it start once or twice each day. The results will be mailed to you, and I suggest saving the excel file to a Dropbox folder, so you can access it from anywhere, anytime.
