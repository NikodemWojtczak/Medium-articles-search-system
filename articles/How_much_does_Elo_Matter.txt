What is elo?

Elo is a calculated score used to rank players in head-to-head competitions like chess or basketball games. Many people have seen the actual formula behind this algorithm because Andrew Garfield writes it on the window of a Harvard dorm room in The Social Network.

How Important is it?

When Magnus Carlsen played Fabiano Caruana for the Chess World Championships, Magnus had an Elo rating of 2,835 vs. Fabiano’ s 2,832. Does this difference matter at all? With an Elo of ~1,250, what are my chances of beating Magnus? In this article I detail how I used Python to gather, transform, and analyze data to understand how important Elo is for predicting the winner of a game.

Gathering the Data

To understand Elo’s relationship to the predicted outcome of a game, I first scraped data from over 100,000 games on chess.com with the below script. Here I loop through through chess games by appending a random number to the end of the url “https://www.chess.com/live/game/” and pull the game result with the helper function get_chess_info(). This function returns a string like the below example, so I then use a second helper function, parse_text(), to transform this into useful data.
