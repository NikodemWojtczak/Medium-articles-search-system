Introduction

One of the major goals of the modern enterprise of data science and analytics is to solve complex optimization problems for business and technology companies to maximize their profit.

In my article “Linear Programming and Discrete Optimization with Python”, we touched on basic discrete optimization concepts and introduced a Python library PuLP for solving such problems.

Although a linear programming (LP) problem is defined only by linear objective function and constraints, it can be applied to a surprisingly wide variety of problems in diverse domains ranging from healthcare to economics, business to military.

In this article, we show one such amazing application of LP using Python programming in the area of economic planning — maximizing the expected profit from a stock market investment portfolio while minimizing the risk associated with it.

The 1990 Nobel prize in Economics went to Harry Markowitz, acknowledged for his famous Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), as it is known in the parlance of financial markets. The original paper was published long back in 1952.
