Member-only story Using the Pandas “Resample” Function

The next best thing to changing the past — aggregating it. A technical introduction to the pandas resample function. Jeremy Chow · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 8 min read · Sep 11, 2019 -- 4 Share

This article is an introductory dive into the technical aspects of the pandas resample function for datetime manipulation. I hope it serves as a readable source of pseudo-documentation for those less inclined to digging through the pandas source code!

If you’d like to check out the code used to generate the examples and see more examples that weren’t included in this article, follow the link here.

Let’s get started!

What is resampling?

Resampling is necessary when you’re given a data set recorded in some time interval and you want to change the time interval to something else. For example, you could aggregate monthly data into yearly data, or you could upsample hourly data into minute-by-minute data.

The syntax of resample is fairly straightforward:

<DataFrame or Series>.resample(arguments).<aggregate function>

I’ll dive into what the arguments are and how to use them, but first here’s a basic, out-of-the-box demonstration. You will need a datetime type index or column to do the following:
