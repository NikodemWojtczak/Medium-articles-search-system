2. Repository Cleaner

If you have accidentally committed files locally that exceeds 100MB, you would have a hard time trying to push it to GitHub. It cannot be solved by removing the large files and committing again. This is because GitHub keeps track of every commit, not just the latest one. You are technically pushing files in your entire commit record.

While you could technically resolve it by branching, it is by no means straightforward. Fortunately, you can run a repository cleaner and it automatically cleans all the large file commits.

Download BFG Repo-Cleaner bfg.jar and run the following command:

It automatically cleans your commits and produces a new commit with the comment ‘remove large files’. Push it and you are good to go.
