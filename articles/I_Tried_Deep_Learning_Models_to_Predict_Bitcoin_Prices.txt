Not too long ago, we delved into the usage of Machine Learning models to predict the future prices of Bitcoin. There we used two time series models to forecast the direction in which the price of Bitcoin may go in the next few days or weeks. It was pretty straightforward in regards to training and fitting the model to Bitcoin’s historical price data. But, what if there was another way besides Machine Learning to forecast time series data?

The answer to that question is…

Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning but the key difference between the two is that Deep Learning uses Neural Networks which grants the machine the ability to train itself. Machine learning requires algorithms with parameters set by the user or engineer to train the machine. In other words, Machine Learning requires more hands-on tweaking and fixing than Deep Learning. Deep Learning is capable of doing all the tweaking and fixing itself without the need of any hands-on interference by the user/engineer. The main thing that they need to tweak or create is the Neural Network itself, which has its own set of obstacles.

But is Deep Learning better than Machine Learning?

Well that depends entirely on the problem. In some cases, traditional Machine Learning models are much better than complex Neural Networks. One such case we found is the training and fitting of tabular data for classification. In that scenario, the Neural Network’s time to train was significantly longer but performed at a lesser or equal level compared to the results of traditional classification algorithms. But what about time series data?

Well, that is exactly what we are going to be doing today! We are going to create and run…
