100 Days of Artificial Intelligence

100 days ago I decided to write one article about artificial intelligence every day for 500 days. Since this is day 100, I am now a fifth of the way towards my goal. I have written more than I have ever done before, and been able to focus intently on one topic. It has very much been a humbling experience. The highlights of this goes far beyond writing and in this article I will mention the benefit of thinking aloud; a summary of a few threads followed in my writing; and of what I will write going forward. I have reached a milestone and I am proud that I managed to take this small step towards understanding artificial intelligence better.

Thinking aloud on a topic you care about

The immediate benefit that I thought about when writing regularly was becoming a better writer. Now that I have written regularly for 100 days I do in no way think that is the greatest benefit I have received. There is a Chinese saying that resonates with me in this regard.

请教别人一次是5分钟的傻子，从不请教别人是一辈子的傻子— Qǐngjiào biérén yīcì shì 5 fēnzhōng de shǎzi, cóng bù qǐngjiào biérén shì yībèizi de shǎzi

He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.

I do not think however that one remains a fool forever — listening is important. Yet I feel less foolish for having started to ask such a wide range of questions to this technological development while learning programming alongside different subjects in the field of social science.

Thinking aloud while reading and doing has clear benefits I will outline a few that in my experience is contributing to a learning process:

Friends, professors and colleagues sending me links to articles related to the topic of my interest. Being asked critical questions in regards to your current thinking by a series of different people from different backgrounds. Approaching text can mean being approached by other writers in different capacities for conversations or writing to another audience. Challenging yourself can inspire others to express themselves through writing which may reveal wonderful sides you had yet to discover. Judging your writing in retrospective and present looking back on who you were in a given moment and what you are right now.

Wanting to become a better writer can lead to so much more than grammatical correctness or textual flourish. Writing is interpretation of who you are and a reading by other of what you think. It is as much as words can convey your intentions as it is connecting to the reader beyond the reading. I have been so lucky and fortunate to experience what writing can be beyond my immediate expectations and for that I am grateful.

Feeling artificially intelligent

It is hard to know where to start when you are faced with the two words ‘artificial intelligence’. I spent the first 50 days considering a general approach to artificial intelligence writing about everything I could find. The next 50 days I have spent focusing on AI Safety attempting to connect thoughts from this area to that of the climate crisis. Along the way I have without a doubt felt worthless or like an idiot several times over, at times in passing.

It is a process that is very likely to repeat itself if I continue exploring this field. I have to embrace not knowing to get to know what I do not know — or what I do not know in the unknown unknowns. Discovery within the lack of clarity makes it exciting every day when I write, uncertainty is in some sense a certainty. I do not have to grow fast as long as I continue growing.

不怕慢, 就怕停 — bù pà màn, jiù pà tíng

Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid of standing still.

Understanding takes time, and I am not done yet. I still have 400 days left, however beyond this lies a lifetime. I have met several researchers that have studied artificial intelligence almost since before I was born or has been programming actively for a lifetime. Academics and professionals I appreciate have imparted their learnings to me and I will do my best to carry this forward and contribute with everything I am to society. To give everything I can.

As such to summarise the two topics that I have explored now each in 50 days I would say the following.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a loved and hated concept, an ambiguous suitcase word that is in no way close to being human or not human. A human is more than a series of programmed actions, yet we are also this. Questions are arising of sustainability in regards to artificial intelligence alongside new techniques in machine learning. The climate crisis can be worsened by irresponsible use of technology, particularly when large technology companies self-police or self-evaluate.

is a loved and hated concept, an ambiguous suitcase word that is in no way close to being human or not human. A human is more than a series of programmed actions, yet we are also this. Questions are arising of sustainability in regards to artificial intelligence alongside new techniques in machine learning. The climate crisis can be worsened by irresponsible use of technology, particularly when large technology companies self-police or self-evaluate. AI Safety has to go beyond cybersecurity and possible existential threats. It is additionally a focus on environmental consequences, externalities or fallout from the proliferation of machine learning techniques and growing amounts of data. We talk of safety in a narrow sense in the context of technology often without these perspectives nor governance. That change in dialogue is critical when some companies drift back from a ‘user’ to a ‘citizen’ focus. We have to develop new methods, regulations and practices to address these concerns in an appropriate manner.

It is strange to attempt reducing 100 articles down to two paragraphs, but I did my best and I hope it is worth something to you. You could read through all 100 articles, however I do not think most have the chance or time to do so. I am working on a small project to compile these learnings in a better format that should be announced soon. I ask kindly for your patience and assistance if you are willing to help in any way.

Where do I go or write from here?

I was telling myself I should do more programming every day and relate it to my writing. As such making the next 100 days about Python, one of the most well known programming languages makes sense to me. 100 days dedicated to machine learning for social scientists with qualitative as well as quantitative methods sounds like a fun challenge that I want to undertake.

100 days of Python and math does challenge my boundaries a lot, in fact pushing them. I am in no way comfortable navigating in Python, writing about Python or programming in Python. Therefore this seems to me to be one of the best possible ways to proceed. Exploring code repositories and looking through some Python code every single day for the next 100 days will not make me a great programmer, however it will make me a slightly better programmer.

If you in this context going forward feel disappointed with my writing and that my articles are not at the level you feel necessary I apologise. I would ask if perhaps it would be better with your help in making me understand and learn if you read this.

What is the most important when writing?

The most important when writing is: to not be too obsessed. I cannot say I live this line fully or that it is consistent with my current actions, as you may have guessed. Yet I think it is the most important aspect I can think of in this particular moment.

You can obsess over your mistakes, worrying that everyone will notice how terrible you are. You can obsess over your lack of knowledge on a topic, being almost sure that someone is talking about your writing unfavourably. You can obsess over what you should have written once a piece is finally published and go back again for endless revisions. All this is well and fine.

Most of all however you can obsess about writing instead of love.

This is the most devastating of all obsessions relating to writing. When you type away on your keyboard and you see someone you love wanting your attention. It is the gravest sin for a writer to ignore love.

To forget to be proud of the person you love and tell them how great they are through your actions is not okay. I am guilty on all these accounts, and it is something I have to change if I am to continue writing for another 100 or 400 days.

When reaching a milestone it is customary to thank someone, and there are plenty of people that has made this learning experience rewarding.

I want to first say a thank you to my wife who always understands and is patient beyond my understanding. I want to thank my family for supporting me through avid reading of my articles. I want to thank my fellow students for challenging my assumptions and my professors for questioning the foundations of my ideas. Lastly to my friends you give me the confidence to share and challenge myself: thank you.
