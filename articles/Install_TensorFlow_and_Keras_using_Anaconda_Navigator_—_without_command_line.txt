Why am I writing this?

I played around with pip install with multiple configurations for several hours, tried to figure how to properly set my python environment for TensorFlow and Keras.

why is tensorflow so hard to install — 600k+ results

unable to install tensorflow on windows site:stackoverflow.com — 26k+ results

Just before I gave up, I found this…

This article will walk you through the process how to install TensorFlow and Keras by using GUI version of Anaconda. I assumed you have downloaded and installed Anaconda Navigator already.

Let’s get started!

Launch Anaconda Navigator. Go to Environments tab and click ‘Create’.

Go to ‘Environments tab’, click ‘Create’

2. Input new environment name, I put ‘tensorflow_env’. Make sure to select Python 3.6 here! Then ‘Create’, this may take few minutes.

make sure to select Python 3.6

3. At your new ‘tensorflow_env’ environment. Select ‘Not installed’, type in ‘tensorflow’. Then, tick ‘tensorflow’ and ‘Apply’. The pop-up window will appear, go ahead and apply. This may take several minutes.

Do the same for ‘keras’.

Check your installation by importing the packages. If everything is okay, the command will return nothing. If the installation was unsuccessful, you will get an error.

no error pop up — Yeah!

You can also try with Spyder.

And…Ta-da! It’s done! You can follow this article to test your newly installed packages :)
