Variational Quantum Circuits

Certain quantum circuits behave very much like the neural networks we know and love from machine learning. We can develop “variational quantum circuits” that mimic the behavior of the deep neural networks that have become so popular and effective in deep learning. The gates in these circuits behave like layers of a neural network, and we can train them in various ways to perform all the same tasks as the neural networks you might use in TensorFlow or Pytorch.

In fact, in many cases, quantum methods provide an extreme improvement in computational power and accuracy. Even simulating such methods classically has shown up to 100x improvement as seen in applications of TensorNetwork, a library built by Google which uses TensorFlow as its backend and allows users to replace layers of a neural network with a tensor network. If you’re not familiar with what tensor networks are, check out my other post on how they can be used to simulate quantum circuits, and how they are being used in machine learning by Google and others.

Okay, so quantum circuits can be trained like neural networks and can perform tasks that neural networks can. Then what? Well, then you can run it on an actual quantum computer! I know, most of the news you’ve read says quantum computing is still several years out and that practical applications are still unclear. That information is horribly outdated and inaccurate. Don’t believe me? Try out IBMQ Quantum Experience and see for yourself. IBM currently allows users to sign up for a free account and develop code in Qiskit, which can then be run on one of the IBM quantum computers. In fact, I have a Github tutorial repo showing you how to use open source software PennyLane to perform various quantum machine learning tasks! Let’s have a look at one of those examples.
