Generating the dataset

We generate an artificial dataset. The first thing that came to my mind is an order registry, in which we store:

id of the client

of the client name of the product

of the product date of purchase

of purchase amount of product purchased

of product purchased the unit price of a certain product

As this is only a toy example, we do not dive deeply into the logic behind the dataset. We can agree that it vaguely resembles a real-life scenario. For testing the performance of different approaches, we generate 10 million rows of data.
