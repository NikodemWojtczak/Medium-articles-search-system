Data Privacy Regulations are Sweeping the Globe

A few recent headlines say it all: the European Union has imposed a number of data protection and privacy constraints under the General Data Protection Regulation. France recently fined Google 50 million euros for misleading people on how it uses people’s data. In the United States, the New York Times published a major series of articles highlighting the privacy issues. In Canada, the government recently updated its Elections Modernization Act to regulate foreign election interference using social media.

And even Facebook is making a compelling case for much more expansive and stronger data privacy and protection regulation based up a recent article by Facebook’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg.

While the social media giants have been at the forefront of data privacy concerns, highly publicized data breaches by large corporations have also captured the headlines. Equifax has spent over $240 million in IT and security improvements as a result of a data breach that impacted about almost 148 million consumers. JP Morgan issued an SEC filing highlighting a data breach in 2014 that compromised data for 76 million customers. Yahoo exposed data from 3 billion user accounts in 2013 resulting in a market capitalization loss in the hundreds of millions while it was in negotiations to be purchased by Verizon. And there are many more examples.

But the bottom line is this: lax data management capabilities have a tangible and material cost — to companies, but more importantly to people — causing a rapid change in the regulatory environment governing user data and privacy which are, in time, sure to propagate to many more jurisdictions. These changes will have a material impact to how enterprise manage their data. As a prime consumer of data, this is sure to impact how to AI/ML operates in the enterprise.
