I am a big fan of learning through practical application. I have found that when studying machine learning, it can be really useful to obtain some publically available data sets to apply the latest technique I have learnt to. Or you might want a really simple data set to benchmark a solution or compare different algorithms before tackling a real data set.

In the following post, I am going to list the best resources I have found for obtaining completely free data sets for machine learning applications.

UCI

The UCI Machine Learning Repository currently has 476 publically available data sets specifically for machine learning and data analysis. The data sets are helpfully tagged up with categories e.g. Classification, Regression, Recommender-Systems, etc so you can easily search for a data set to practice a particular machine learning technique.

Almost all the data sets are derived from the real world (as opposed to toy data sets) meaning that you will encounter similar challenges to those faced in a real machine learning project. There is an extremely wide range of topics to choose from and all the datasets have previously been studied which means that they have the potential to yield good results in a model.

Kaggle

Kaggle is another great resource for machine learning data sets. Currently, there are 19,515 data sets listed on this page. One of the nice things about Kaggle is that on the landing page for each data set there is a preview of the data. So you can quickly visualise the type of data you will be dealing with before downloading.

The advantages of using Kaggle are that you will often find a number of kernels relating to each data set. These are areas where other users display code examples of working with the data and can be a good way to get started. In addition, many of the data sets are linked or have been linked, in the past to competitions with leaderboards. This provides a good resource to benchmark how wellâ€¦
