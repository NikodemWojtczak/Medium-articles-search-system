We’ve learnt about p-values many times before. First, in the statistics book we crammed at university; second, when we read some articles assuring us they were legitimate; and finally now as we decide how to run our businesses. Throughout this, we’re told definitions, and hopefully, we’ve learnt enough to regurgitate something about null hypotheses and probabilities — but do we really understand?

Understanding is more than knowing a definition, and to effectively use p-values it’s necessary to have a ‘feel’ for what they mean. To do this, we’ll take a visual approach.

In fact, when you look into p-values through visuals, they’re remarkably straight-forward, and that’s what I’d like to share with you today.

We’ll follow this rough guideline:

How can I be sure my Conversion Rate is what I think it is?

Measuring Probabilities

The AB Test Scenario

The first few paragraphs will cover some basics so feel free to skip over these, but don’t forget to check the visuals!

Let’s start by looking at a simple p-value before moving on to the all-important AB Test scenario that shapes product decisions around the world in all your favourite apps, services and programs. Hopefully, after reading this (or bookmarking) you can understand the p-value in all its glory, like I finally have.

Note that the following content will be around e-commerce products but take note the understanding can be applied when dealing with various outher scenarios.

Your First CVR

Imagine this: you’ve launched a new website, and you’d like to know what your conversion rate (CVR) is, so you begin to measure the sessions and the conversions. Using these you can calculate a simple proportion for the conversion rate as:

CVR = Conversions / Sessions

You measure 1000 sessions and 50 conversions which gives you a CVR of 5% — awesome! But wait, how accurate is that 5%?

If you measure another 1000 sessions, will you get another 50 conversions or will it be something different? This is where our friend…
