Introduction

Starbucks is a global coffee company selling coffee, tea, espresso drinks, bakery, and grab-and-go offerings in 75 countries. One of the company’s values is “Creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.” Therefore, it utilizes many channels to market its products from social media to TV spots and ads. Starbucks executes its extraordinary marketing strategy by deploying a combination of marketing media channels, where it creates brand recognition. Starbucks does not only understand its products and customers, but also keeps up with how its customers use technology. Starbucks App enables customers to keep track of the available offers and happy hour deals at participating stores. It allows customers to earn and collect stars (collect two stars per $1) that can be redeemed in-store or via the app.

“With nearly 100 million customers in our stores every week, we’re looking for more opportunities to engage directly and personally, providing them with special benefits and offers that are meaningful” — Matt Ryan, executive vice president and chief strategy officer for Starbucks.

Here, we are going to investigate and analysis three files that simulate how people make purchasing decisions and how promotional offers influence those decisions. A sneak of the final data after being cleaned and analyzed: the data contains information about 8 offers sent to 14,825 customers who made 26,226 transactions while completing at least one offer. Below are two examples of the types of offers Starbucks sends to its customers through the app to encourage them to purchase products and collect stars.
