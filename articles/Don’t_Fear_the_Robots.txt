It is impressive.

It is also very well choreographed and staged.

Impressive as the tech here is, it is important to remember that the Boston Dynamics videos are trailers for a movie that isn’t yet made. Look hard enough, you can find the blooper reels of the robots that are so impressive running, jumping, and doing other things failing as they work out the kinks.

Because the videos are not just videos, they are advertisements. For funding and investments. An actual warehouse environment is much different than the staged demo shown here. The AI will get there, someday, but it is only as good as it’s programing, and anyone who has spent time in the logistics and transportation industry will tell you it only takes one misread SKU code, or one mis-bayed item, or one wrong label, to make a whole lot of mess. The problems in becoming more efficient in logistics isn’t just the streamlining of processes, but the ability to problem solve and adapt on the fly in an very dynamic environment. That decision making ability is make-or-break in most situations in an environment that is long stretches of mind-numbingly repetitive actions punctuated by moments of intense and desperate revisions to the process. Automation is fantastic at the first, but the latter is a great challenge, and also the difference in success or failure. Robots that seek to fully replace humans have to do that, not just the manual labor aspect, and the most advanced robot is still only as good as it’s programing. As of yet, whatever “thinking” they do still has to be programmed in, and industries like logistics which are organized chaos on the best of days have far more variables than can…
