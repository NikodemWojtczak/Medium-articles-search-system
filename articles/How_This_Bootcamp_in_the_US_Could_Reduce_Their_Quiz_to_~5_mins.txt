How This Bootcamp in the US Could Reduce Their Quiz to ~5 mins

Recently I worked on a project for a US bootcamp from Denver that has been teaching people how to code for the past 5 years. As a part of the admission process, candidates are asked 8 questions out of a bank of 12 questions to test their logical thinking. The school wanted to know if and how, using some data science analysis, this quiz could be reduced in time.

Now, it takes about 1 hour to complete, and ~50% of the people that sign up never start the quiz. Ideally, the school would be able to ask fewer questions, while keeping the ones that give good information on whether a candidate is good or not. Potentially, a shorter quiz could get more people to take it and eventually join the school if they pass, which would also make the companyâ€™s revenue to go up.
