Hello old friend

N ote to all of my non-US readers, please forgive me for referring to this sport as “soccer” and not “football”. Enjoy!

Growing up in Kansas City, I cherish many fond memories of attending KC Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City) games with my family. Being a soccer player myself (not a very good one, mind you), I loved watching my favorite athletes duke it out on the field in an endless pursuit of finding the back of the net. To bide time between games, I often found myself reading promotional information for the rosters, learning everything I could about my idols.

As I got older, my attention strayed to leagues overseas, but with the recent resurgence of the MLS over the past several years, I now crave a return to the league that I fell in love with as a child.

The sports industry has changed dramatically during my decade-plus hiatus of MLS-fandom, with the biggest difference being the introduction and dominance of fantasy sports. The fantasy sports industry has absolutely exploded in popularity over the years and has helped introduce many fans to a new sport or league, encouraging them to follow games when they would otherwise have no reason or desire to. Due to this inclusive nature of fantasy sports, I decided to turn to MLS Fantasy to help me re-learn the teams and the stars. Being the data nerd that I am, I wasn’t going to let mere guesswork dictate my fantasy squad, but create an algorithm which will determine an optimal lineup for me instead.

Setting the house rules

Before we dive into the algorithm I used and the results I achieved, we need to define the rules and constraints of MLS Fantasy. Any veterans out there can skip ahead to the next section as this will simply be a review.

The basic premise of MLS Fantasy is to create a squad every match-week that will return the most points. These points can be gained by performing positive actions on the pitch…
