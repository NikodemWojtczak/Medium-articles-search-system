In my original 2018 article I looked at demand for general skills such as statistics and communication. I also looked at demand for technologies such as Python and R. Software technologies change much faster than demand for general skills, so I include only technologies in this updated analysis.

This time I decided to write the code to scrape the job listings instead of searching by hand. This endeavor proved fruitful for SimplyHired, Indeed, and Monster. I was able to use the Requests and Beautiful Soup Python libraries. You can see the Jupyter notebook with the code for the scraping and analysis at my GitHub repo.

Scraping LinkedIn proved far more arduous. Authentication is required to see an exact count of job listings. I decided to use Selenium for headless browsing. In September 2019, a United States Supreme Court case was decided against LinkedIn, allowing LinkedIn‚Äôs data to be scraped.

LinkedIn‚Äôs data might not have provided an apples-to-apples comparison from last year to this year, anyway. This summer I noticed that LinkedIn started having huge fluctuations from week to week for some tech job search terms. I hypothesize that they might have been experimenting with their search results algorithm by using natural language processing to gauge‚Ä¶
