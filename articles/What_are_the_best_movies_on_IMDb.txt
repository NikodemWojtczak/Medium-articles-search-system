An insight on movies ratings on IMDb Mubarak Ganiyu · Follow 5 min read · Dec 27, 2019 -- Share

“Don’t shut the door all the way. I don’t like that. Just…leave it open a little bit.”

These are the last words to what I can say without a doubt is the best film of 2019 which is The Irishman. After this last scene, the ending credits complement the beautifully composed song, In the Still of the Night by The Five Satins.

Watching The Irishman was a great experience. I sat back and spent the entire morning of Thanksgiving watching it on Netflix. It was a phenomenal movie. I saw Robert De Niro deliver a 10/10 performance as he went from playing a young man in his forties to playing an old man in his nineties.

He played his part so well that he impeccably applied the motion and mannerism to the respective ages that he played. I also witnessed amazing scenes with a lot of great acting by other actors like Joe Pesci, Al Pacino and Anna Pacquin.

I love watching movies especially classically directed movies made by the likes of Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino. I watch movies by these filmmakers because of how the actors have meaningful conversations, how the camera angle captures stunning moments and how the movies convey powerful symbols.

Movies like this make me wonder which movies are the highest rated on IMDb and ask questions as to how the quality of movies has changed over time.

Thus, a research was conducted to find out the top-rated movies on IMDb.
