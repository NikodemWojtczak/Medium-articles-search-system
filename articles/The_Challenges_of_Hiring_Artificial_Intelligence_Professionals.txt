I was speaking to my manager the other day over coffee and the conversation steered towards the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). While on that topic, he commented that, “In the field of AI, many people talk but don’t deliver”. While what he said was true in general, I feel that success or failure of AI projects are predetermined at the point of hiring.

The Professionals

This group of people has years of experience working in AI. They know how to build and deploy ML models, plan and execute a ML project with a given timeline, and know the ins and outs of building a successful data science team.

At this stage in their career, these people are earning big bucks. They are well sought after and they are…
