Python, like most many programming languages, has a huge amount of exceptional libraries and modules to choose from. Generally of course, this is absolutely brilliant, but it also means that sometimes the modules don’t always play nicely with each other. In this short tutorial, I’m going to show you how to link up spaCy with Gensim to create a coherent topic modeling pipeline.

Yeah, great. What’s a topic model?

Good question. I thought about re-writing the Wikipedia definition, then thought that I probably should just give you the Wikipedia definition:

In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents.

Basically, we’re looking for what collections of words, or topics, are most relevant to discussing the content of the corpus. For this tutorial we’ll be using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

A short note about libraries

For those of you folks who aren’t aware, Gensim is one of the pre-eminent libraries for topic modeling. Meanwhile, spaCy is a powerful natural language processing library that has won a lot of admirers in the last few years.

Building the pipeline

First things first, let’s import our libraries:
