The data science jobs are considered to be the sexiest jobs of the 21st century. It’s a bold statement to make, mostly because we’re in 2019 currently, so who knows what the job market will look like in 50 years.

Nevertheless, if we look only at the job titles from the last 15–20 years, then it’s a whole another story. Stay with me in this article and you’ll find out some of the most amazing resources to break into the data science field. Whether you have a degree in some other field or not is completely irrelevant.

Some time back I’ve published an article about ins and outs of being self-taught vs. getting a degree in data science:

That article went in-depth on both options, so check it out if you’re interested in the topic. Today, however, I want to further explore the self-taught route and provide you with some amazing resources to get started.

Who is this article for?

Those without any degree

Those who finished college some time ago and want to switch to data science

Okay, let’s not waste any more time with the intro — now we’ll dive into the real stuff.

What does it mean to be self-taught?

Good question. What it means, in a nutshell, is that you didn’t finish any college degree in a field of interest (let’s say data science), and you’re working in the field of interest (once again, data science), then you’re considered to be a self-taught in that area of interest.

You’re still free to finish online courses and to read books, but you didn’t spend a couple of years behind the college desks getting a formal education.

Okay, now when that’s out of the way, let’s dive into the first way of being a self-taught data scientist.
