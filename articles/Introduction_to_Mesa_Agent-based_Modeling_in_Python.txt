Python-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON for agent-based modeling

Simulation result showing segregation between blue and red agent

Agent-based modeling relies on simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to evaluate their effects on the system. It is often used to predict the projections that we will obtain given a complex phenomena. The main purpose is to obtain explanatory insight on how the agents will behave given a particular set of rules. Agent-based modeling has been extensively used in numerous industry such as biology, social sciences, network and business. This article covers the necessary steps to kick-start your agent-based modeling project using an open-source python module called Mesa. There are 4 sections in this tutorial:

1. Setup

Setup is pretty straightforward for Mesa. Make sure to create a new virtual environment. I name the environment as mesaenv. Open up your terminal and change the directory to mesaenv and activate the virtual environment using the following code:

Virtual Environment

Run the following command to activate the virtual environment depending on your use case.

#Anaconda

conda activate mesaenv #Terminal

source bin/activate

Python modules

This tutorial requires three modules:

mesa

matplotlib

jupyter

python3 -m pip install mesa

python3 -m pip install matplotlib

python3 -m pip install jupyter

Base folder

Create a base folder called Mesa that you will use to store all the python files. You should have the following files in the base folder at the end of this sections:

Feel free to download it in case you got lost somewhere in the tutorial. Once you are done, letâ€™s proceed to the next section.
