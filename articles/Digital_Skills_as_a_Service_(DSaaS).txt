Chapter #1 — Knowledge is Dead asset

Have you ever thought about what will be in the future with your experience and skills that you are getting during your lifetime?

We are working on average 40–50 years, and during this time, we are getting everyday new bits of knowledge. When we are talking about the IT industry, people in this industry are working with some particular software or technologies, so they are becoming experts at some point in time.

In 40–50 years, all our skills are becoming dead assets for us. Of course, we can train new people, and we can transfer part of our knowledge to them. I wasn’t able to find any research regarding this, but I believe if we take all our knowledge and skills as a 100% then most probably we can transfer a maximum of 0.000001% of it. The rest of them is a dead asset.

A few years ago, I started asking myself if there is a way to transform my knowledge into the digital asset so that expertise will work in the future, and they will not become a dead asset. I know that this is not possible today, and of course, there is no way to digitalize our brain. Some time ago, I decided to try to transform some small part of my knowledge.
