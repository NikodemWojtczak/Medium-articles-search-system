3 Great Additions for your Jupyter Notebooks

I love Jupyter notebooks and the power they provide.

They can be used to present findings as well as share code in the most effective manner which was not easy with the previous IDEs.

Yet there is something still amiss.

There are a few functionalities I aspire in my text editor which donâ€™t come by default in Jupyter.

But fret not. Just like everything in Python, Jupyter too has third-party extensions.

This post is about some of the most useful extensions I found.

1. Collapsible Headings

The one extension, I like most is collapsible headings.

It makes the flow of the notebook easier to comprehend and also helps in creating presentable notebooks.

To get this one, install the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions package with this command on the terminal window:

conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Once the package is installed, we can start jupyter notebook using:

jupyter notebook

Once you go to the home page of your jupyter notebook, you can see that a new tab for NBExtensions is created.

And we can get a lot of extensions using this package.

This is how it looks:
