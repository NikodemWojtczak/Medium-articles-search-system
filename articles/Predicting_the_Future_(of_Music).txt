Predicting the Future (of Music)

Taylor Fogarty, Peter Worcester, Lata Goudel

In the era of Big Data, we have the all-time advantage when it comes to making predictions. With websites like Kaggle.com and OurWorldinData.org, we have endless data at our fingertips- data we can use to predict things like who will win the NCAA tournament in 2020, how many avocados will be sold globally next month, or the crime rate in Chicago 10 years from now. Of course these are all still predictions, but these predictions can’t be made without appropriate data.

For instance, we spent a beautiful summer day testing to see if you can predict a song’s placement on Spotify’s Top 100 List based on a given set of metrics.

Objective and Data Description

From Kaggle.com, we obtained this list for 2018 which included 13 variables such as tempo, duration, acoustic-ness, and valence (positivity) for each song as well as identifiers (artist name, track id, and artist name). For our purposes, we ignored the identifiers in order to focus on the numeric qualities of the songs since we already know that Post Malone releases the greatest hits of this generation. Our main goal: find the most important factors in determining what makes one song more popular than another so we can predict how popular a new song may be. To do this, we used three different metrics for evaluating different linear models. For the sake of simplicity, we did not include higher order or interaction terms, so there very well may be more to this than the variables we used (spoiler alert: there definitely is).

Important note: All 3 of these metrics should be used whenever you are evaluating and comparing models. They are separated into “methods” for our purposes, but should be used cohesively in order to best evaluate a model’s accuracy.

Method 1: Error Analysis

Once a model has been developed, the next step is to see how well it performs. To measure the success of the…
