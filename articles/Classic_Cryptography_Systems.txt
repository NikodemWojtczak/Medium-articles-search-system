Written communication is found in every instance of our history — dating back to our earliest days as a species. Prior to our discovery of agriculture & permanent settlements, nomadic tribes famously left behind stories of triumphs & hardships in primitive language structures known as proto-writing(s). Once we began settling, however, the utility of written communication rightly evolved. Previously, nomadic tribes feared nature most in the form of predatory animals & cataclysmic climate events; post-settlement, however, other tribes took the mantle as the largest threats.

Interactions among early settlements forced the birth of diplomacy, which, in turn, pushed communication & language to evolve. Specifically, it led to the necessity of secrecy & encryption. How could communities guard their most trusted secrets, or trust messengers carrying their most trusted secrets, without risking said secrets falling into the wrong hands?

Enter Cryptography

Building Blocks of Cryptography: Ciphers

Ciphers are arguably the basic building blocks of cryptography — they’re certainly the earliest recorded implementations of encryption. In fancy crypto-lingo, a cipher is simply a series of steps that scrambles (encrypts) the original message, known as a plaintext, to a resultant message known as a ciphertext.

The earliest ciphers recorded in history were quite rudimentary, usually encrypted by hand or a simple mechanical device. In order to gain a deeper understanding of goals & principles behind ciphers, we’ll walk through three of these simple, manually-encrypted ciphers of historical significance:

While these early examples provide ample learning opportunities & highlight key points, they’re light-years behind their modern counterparts. Powerful, publicly-known ciphers make up the cornerstone of communication security — for example, the famous AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) that’s commonly used all…
