But, as Samuel Johnson once said,

“the chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.”

When it comes to our relationship with machines, Samuel was spot on.

If he were alive today, he would point us to our invisible, digital, machine-operated chains that formed a web of dependencies and habits around ourselves, as strong as they are invisible.

Machines-bound habits = slavery?!

What am I talking about? A very quick back-of-the-envelope calculation (I was trained as scientist, so numbers speak…) can shed some light on the statement above. It’s not that hard to show that machines have already enslaved our race, starting decades ago!

Slavery? Yes, or the “mode of production in which slaves constitute the principal work force”.

While we think that machines are ‘doing the work’ for us, it’s easy to see that machines can’t really do much without consuming a huge chunk, sometimes 100% of our mental and physical power just to operate them.

A study from Harvard Health Watch found that the average American spends 101 minutes per day operating a machine. That machine is called car. This means…
