Sky News: London

Recently I wrote “The incidence of the disease in the population is a critical variable which many people overlook” in my Naive Bayes post.

Today when browsing the news I happened across Sky News’ article and noted they’d fallen into this exact trap.

Researchers found that the controversial system is 81% inaccurate

The incidence of the suspects in the crowd is a critical variable which Sky News has overlooked

Why is this? Let’s try varying the the incidence of suspects in the crowd to see why it is so important.

System 1: Randomly tosses a coin to assess guilt, accuses 50%

System 2: Error rate of 1 in 1,000 Crowd A: 32,000 suspects; 0 innocent people

Crowd B: 0 suspects; 32,000 innocent people

Which system is better?

System 1 on Crowd A - 16000 suspects; 100% accurate!

System 2 on Crowd B - 32 mistakes; 100% inaccurate!

The incidence of suspects in the crowd makes a huge difference. Sky News ignores crowd composition measuring only accuracy so by this methodology System 1’s coin tosses win out.

So let’s try bringing the theory from my previous naive Bayes post into this real world example.

First we need to start with this quote:

They found that, of 42 matches, only eight were verified as correct — an error rate of 81%. Four of the 42 were people who were never found because they were absorbed into the crowd, so a match could not be verified.

The math is simple:

But “Four of the 42 were people who were never found” so I don’t know why they are counted. We don’t know whether all four were incorrect, correct or some mix. It seems to me that those examples need to be discarded, leaving us with 8 matches out of 38 or 79% incorrect, but I digress.

We need more details on the system performance. In the article we can find a police force error estimate of 1 in 1000:

The force maintains its technology only makes a mistake in one in 1,000 cases — but it uses a different measurement to arrive at this conclusion.

Since they’ve quoted a single number; false negative/positive are not broken out so we’ll assume it’s the same for both. Now what are these numbers in terms of Bayes? Despite my disagreement I’ll use their 19% or 0.19:

TP = True Positive = 0.999

FP = False Negative = 0.001 P(B ∣ A) P(A)

P(A ∣ B) = ──────────────

P(B)

A = Suspect

B = Positive Neoface match P(A ∣ B) = Probability a person is a suspect given a match = 0.19

P(B ∣ A) = Probability of a match given a suspect = TP = 0.999

P(A) = Probability of a person in the crowd being a criminal

P(B) = Probability of a Neoface match = FP × (1-P(A)) + TP × P(A)

Plug in the formula and the values, solve for P(A) and working it out with a pencil (definitely not using Wolfram Alpha) you get:

19/80938

Or ~1 in 4000. Is this a reasonable estimate for the number of wanted suspects in a random crowd? The UK prison population is ~1 in 1000. That puts the number of suspects known to the police on the same order of magnitude as prisoners, but 4 times fewer. Seems reasonable.

Let’s do a sanity check on the numbers for a crowd of 32,000 people, we’ve estimated 1 in 4000 is a suspect and the system is (claimed) 99.9% reliable in detecting them. So 8 of 8 suspects detected. It is also (claimed) 99.9% reliable in rejecting non-suspects so of the 31,992 non-suspects 32 would be wrongly detected. Let’s expand our earlier examples:

System 1: Randomly tosses a coin to assess guilt, accuses 50%

System 2: Error rate of 1 in 1,000 Crowd A: 32,000 suspects; 0 innocent people

Crowd B: 0 suspects; 32,000 innocent people

Crowd C: 8 suspects; 31,992 innocent people System 1 on Crowd A - 16000 suspects; 100% accurate!

System 2 on Crowd B - 32 mistakes; 100% inaccurate!

System 2 on Crowd C - 8 suspects, 32 mistakes; 80% inaccurate!

We’ve come round a full circle and gotten back to the headline number of 80% inaccurate. So the following things can be true simultaneously:

The system has a false negative and false positive rate of 0.1% In a crowd of 32000 people 32 of 40 or 80% would be wrongly flagged

The above two things can be true if suspects occur at a rate of 1 in 4000 in a random crowd.

The incidence of the suspects in the crowd is a critical variable
