How To Build A Speech Recognition Bot With Python

You may have realized something now.

The overwhelming success of speech-enabled products like Amazon Alexa has proven that some degree of speech support will be an essential aspect of household technology for the foreseeable future.

In other words, speech-enabled products would be a game changer as that offer a level of interactivity and accessibility that few technologies can match.

No GUI needed.

No texting needed.

No Emojis needed.

It’s all about speed.

Speed is a big reason voice is poised to become the next major user interface. Each decade, we’ve embraced a new way to interact with technology. We’ve evolved from character mode to a graphical user interface, to the web, to mobile.

Voice now offers a faster and easier way to communicate and accomplish tasks than mobile apps.

We can either tell Alexa what we need (turn off the lights, adjust the thermostat, and set an alarm — or all of the above using a single utterance like “Alexa, good night”), or you can pull your phone, unlock it, open the right app, and perform the task or tasks.

When you consider habitual use cases — those that keep customers coming back over time — the efficiency gained through voice adds up over time.
