3 Pandas Functions You Should Be Using More Often

There’s no denying that Pandas is a powerful library. If you are a daily Python user, it might just be your favorite library for data analysis and some quick visualizations. Dario Radečić · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Oct 23, 2019 -- 7 Share

With that being said, it’s very easy to get used to some core concepts of Pandas and to neglect further exploration of its capabilities. I mean, who hasn’t been guilty of reinventing the wheel? While it’s not necessarily a bad thing (because you know exactly what your code should do), often there are smarter ways to achieve the same.

Today I want to share with you 3 functions that I wasn’t using as much as I should so far, and I also want to show you what exactly I mean by reinventing the wheel. A couple of weeks back I’ve written a similar article, only related to pure Python. If you are someone who reinvents the wheel much, don’t hesitate to check it out:

Okay, enough talk, let’s dive into some Pandas.

The Dataset Used

As with many of my articles, I’ll be using the famous Titanic dataset. I’m sure you know how to import it, so here’s what you should have before proceeding:

Are we on the same page? Good, let’s proceed.

1. idxmin() and idxmax()

In a nutshell, those functions will return the ID (the index position) of the desired entry. In the Titanic example, maybe you want to find the index position of the youngest/oldest person. Let’s go even further, you’re interested only in the name of that person.

A typical programmer approach would be to reinvent the wheel because you aren’t aware that idxmin() and idxmax() exist. Here’s one approach:

You’re basically subsetting and returning the value for the desired attribute. Not the cleanest of code, but could be worse. Here’s how to achieve the same by utilizing previously mentioned functions:
