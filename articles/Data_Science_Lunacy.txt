Waning Trust

I have a hard time taking LinkedIn seriously. If your feed is anything like mine, half of it is blatant self-promotion, and the second half is thinly-guised self-promotion by means of bumper-sticker-esque slogans.

I suppose there’s nothing inherently weird about that, it certainly aligns with the behavior I’ve witnessed on other social media. Though it’s not the platform that I frequent when I’m looking for inspiration, it can be nice to see little blurbs about perseverance and achievement, or an observation that reinforces my bubble. I don’t want to have to view the cold, naked truth of an uncaring and unfair world.

Yes, random HR guru: I absolutely agree — even if the data doesn’t support it — that people quit bosses, not jobs. Thanks for reaffirming my worldview.

But, there is one inspirational message (questionably sourced) that causes me no end of consternation; a visceral reaction to something that should be self-evident:

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

Why this morsel of innutritious wisdom is so insoluble is beyond my explanation. Who doesn’t want to build comradery, effectively collaborate, and venture to new heights? What kind of misanthrope would I be if I eschewed these innocuous ideals? Until I hit the lottery, work is not optional, and it’s in my best interest to not end up in the basement looking for my red stapler. So, instead of telling people to pound sand, I go against my baser nature and play well with others.

Luckily for me, my intractable cognitive dissonance has been resolved. Turns out, where you want to go is a more important consideration than the speed and/or distance. Sound crazy? Here’s the math:

Talk nerdy to me.

Work done is independent of the path taken, so we probably should decide where to go before wandering aimlessly. If you want an uncommon solution, a large team is not the best route to take.

So why do I feel so much worse?
