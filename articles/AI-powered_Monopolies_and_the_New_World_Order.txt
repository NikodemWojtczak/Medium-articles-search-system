AI-powered Monopolies and the New World Order

Artificial intelligence and new technologies will undoubtedly bring about tremendous changes. They will have far-reaching impacts upon our daily lives, our work, security, and values.

AI is arguably the most existential challenge humanity has ever witnessed, for it will cause massive social upheavals and, in the long run, endanger the very essence of our humanity.

When ordinary people hear of the AI threat to humankind, they usually think of two issues: massive job losses and total replacement of humans by robots and the future where algorithms will not just replace us but may even exterminate mankind. There are, however, other menaces that are largely overlooked by people, because media mostly focuses on the first challenge (job losses), whilst Hollywood — on the remote future where robots will supplant humans.

Due to overly focus on these two problems, it is worth examining another, often condoned consequence of the advent of AI. This process that has already begun and is unlikely to be stopped — the formation of AI-powered monopolies.

The Rise of Corporate Power

Even now there is a growing discontent both in the media and regulatory bodies over multinational corporations eclipsing nations-states in power and influence. It is has been rightfully noticed by S. Marcuzzi and A. Terzi that

at a time when democratic governments’ capacity to live up to their citizens’ expectations is shrinking, corporations are amassing tremendous power, not only in terms of money but, most importantly, data.

These companies include so-called MAFIA-G (Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, Google), as well as three Chinese tech giants (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent), or BAT.
