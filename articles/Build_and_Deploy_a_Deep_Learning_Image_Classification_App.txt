In this article Iâ€™ll show you how to go from concept to deployment with a computer vision classification model. With fastai you can quickly build and train a state-of-the-art deep learning model. Then, Render makes hosting and deploying your app a breeze.

Weâ€™ll go step-by-step as we build and deploy a model to classify skin lesion images. When finished, users will be able upload an image to a website and the model will classify their skin lesion.

I plan to write a similar article on NLP soon â€” follow me to make sure you donâ€™t miss it! ðŸ˜„

Disclaimers:

Health/legal: This project is for demonstration purposes only. If you think you may have a skin problem, go see a health care professional. Iâ€™m not a health care professional.

Technical: This example isnâ€™t intended for a large-scale website with millions of hits. If you have that issue â€” well, thatâ€™s a good problem to have. ðŸ˜€ This setup might work. Render uses Docker and Kubernetes behind the scenes to make scaling as close to painless as possible.

Alright â€” back to the action!

Training set images

Skin cancers are the most common group of cancers. A number of apps have been developed to classify skin lesions. By uploading a picture of your suspicious skin spot you can see if you should talk to a dermatologist.

Hereâ€™s the plan:

Find the data. Build and train the model. Deploy the model. Improve model performance.

Letâ€™s flesh this plan out a bit. ðŸ˜‰
