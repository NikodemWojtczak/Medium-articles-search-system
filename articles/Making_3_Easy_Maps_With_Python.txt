In working with geospatial data, I’ve often needed to visualize this data in the most natural way possible: a map. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could use Python to quickly and easily create interactive maps of your data? We’ll be using a data set on all Starbucks locations in Los Angeles County for this tutorial. By the end of this introductory post you will be able to create:

A basic point map of all Starbucks locations in LA County

of all Starbucks locations in LA County A choropleth map which shades in zip codes in LA County based on how many Starbucks are contained in each one

which shades in zip codes in LA County based on how many Starbucks are contained in each one A heatmap which highlights “hotspots” of Starbucks in LA County

Let’s do it!

You will need …

The Python package pandas. This is used to easily manipulate data in Python

This is used to easily manipulate data in Python The Python package folium . This is used to very easily create maps

. This is used to very easily create maps A spreadsheet with latitude/longitude of Starbucks in LA County (on my GitHub here )

) A GeoJSON (basically a json which describes a complex shape) of LA County (here) and a GeoJSON of all the zip codes in LA County (here)

To get familiar with the data, here’s a snapshot of the first few rows:

We only need to worry about the latitude, longitude, and zip fields for this analysis.

Here are the needed Python imports, loading the Starbucks data, and loading the LA County GeoJSON:
