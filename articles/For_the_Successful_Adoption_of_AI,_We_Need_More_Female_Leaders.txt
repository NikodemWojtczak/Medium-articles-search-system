Part I: Differences between Men and Women

A story of how women and men can work differently

Before we dive into why more women should lead AI teams, I want to share a fascinating story I heard from Tania Biland, a 3rd-year student of Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

The story as narrated by Tania:

Last semester, our class got split into three different groups in order to develop a safety technology solution for Swiss or German brands:

Group 1: Only women (my group)

Group 2: Only men

Group 3: Four women and one man

After 4 weeks of work, each team had to present their work.

Group 1, composed of only women, developed a safety solution for women in the dark. As the jury was only male we decided to tell a story using a persona, music, and videos in order to make them feel what women are experiencing on a daily basis. We also put emphasis on the fact that everyone has a mother, sister or wife in their life and that they probably don’t want her/them to suffer. In the end, our solution was rather simple, technologically: using light to provide safety but connected to the audience emotionally.

Group 2, mostly composed of men, presented a more high-tech solution using AI, GPS and video conferences. They based their arguments on facts and numbers and pointed out their competitive advantages.
