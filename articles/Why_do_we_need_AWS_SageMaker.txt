Why do we need AWS SageMaker?

Today, there are several platforms available in the industry that aid software developers, data scientists as well as a layman in developing and deploying machine learning models within no time. Some platforms have made big claims to democratize AI and data science to an extent where you can solve your data science problem with almost no coding skills, while some others claim the fastest and easiest way to deploy a solution in the cloud. All these claims, some very profound, would make you wonder one simple question — What platform works best for me?

The answer to this question is definitely not a straightforward one. Based on your priority, flexibility, scale, cost, preferred ML framework, ease of use, and other aspects, there isn’t just one size fits for all choice that you get. For a meaningful solution, we have to really start by understanding WHY do we need a platform in the first place. Once we understand the ‘WHY’, we then understand ‘HOW’ a given platform will solve the problem for us and then we can finally answer the ultimatum ‘WHAT platform works best for me?’

Starting with the WHY always heads us in the right direction.

Inspired by Simon Sinek’s ‘Start with WHY’

In this blog, my objective is to enlighten you by answering the ‘WHY’, ‘HOW’ and ‘WHAT’ sequences of questions for selecting the best platform for a significant majority of the machine learning solutions in enterprises that we solve in the present day. I would then like to connect ‘AWS Sagemaker’ as a valid candidate for the problem and emphasize the reasons outlined with ‘Why do we need AWS Sagemaker?’ There are obviously other groups of problems and experiments in enterprises, for which this wouldn’t be the best choice; I will try to also highlight a few areas where this would not be the best choice.

Let’s start with the ‘WHY’.
