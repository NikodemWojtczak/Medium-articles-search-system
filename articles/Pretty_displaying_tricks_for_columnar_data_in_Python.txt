Pretty displaying tricks for columnar data in Python

For everyone who has extensively wrangled data using lists, Pandas, or NumPy before, you might have had experienced issues with printing the data in the right way. Especially if there are a lot of columns, displaying the data becomes a hassle. This article shows you how you can print large columnar data in python in a readable way.

To explain clearly, I am using the NYC Property sales data, which has a total of 21 columns.

This is what happens if you have a Pandas DataFrame with many columns and try to print it out with a regular print statement:

import pandas as pd nycdata=pd.read_csv('nyc-rolling-sales.csv',index_col=0) print(nycdata.head())

Data is omitted from printing

This happens as Pandas will detect the number of columns it can fit in the space of your terminal window, which would not display exactly what we need. Most data is omitted from printing to save terminal space on your screen.

To solve this, here are some ways to go.

The GOOD trick

You can increase the max number of columns Pandas lets you display, by adding this line to your code:

pd.options.display.max_columns = None

This removes the max column limit for displaying on the screen. Here is how it looks when printed (printing the first 11 columns only for now..)

Print result after removing max column limit

But hey, that is not totally what we needed. The data is split into multiple lines, with headers divided by backward slashes. This is readable and can be useful, but is still not perfect.

To get over this, simply use this line with your code and you can get all the data in a single line fashion:

pd.options.display.width=None

And this is how it looks like now (printed only 7 columns):
