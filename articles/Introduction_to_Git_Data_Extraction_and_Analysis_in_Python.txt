Is there anyone in the software industry who has never used or at least heard of Git?

Git is a revolutionary tool that is quite ubiquitous in software teams nowadays. This article’s purpose is not to provide an introduction to git, there are a ton of resources that can guide you through that. Its purpose is rather to analyze git relevant data in order to get important insights from those data.

Throughout this article, we are going to extract Git related data by using the Github REST API and then analyze those data by leveraging Python’s top data analysis library, Pandas as well as an interactive data visualization library that is gaining massive popularity, Plotly. We are going to take as example data the repository of Apache Spark.

Git Data Extraction

Git repositories are generally stored in source code hosting facilities. The most popular of these are Github and Bitbucket, but many others are available, like Gitea, GitLab, etc. In this article, we shall focus on Github, but the data extraction process should be similar for the other hosting facilities too.

Github provides a REST API that contains endpoints for all git related resources. In order to be able to consume Github APIs, we need to generate an access token at the Developer Settings on the Github Profile page. After having done that, we should be all set. We start our Jupyter Notebook and we begin by importing the necessary libraries:
