You Don’t Need a Masters To Be a Data Scientist

Here’s my (weird) story on how I became a data scientist without pursuing a master’s degree.

I am not paid for any of the resource I will list below. I am simply sharing what I have done.

University

I enrolled in chemical engineering at McGill University. It is one of the top universities in Canada, and it has quite a good reputation worldwide.

I chose chemical engineering because I was (and still am) very passionate about clean energy technologies. I was motivated in contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable way of producing energy.

Unfortunately, the program fell short of meeting my expectations. Very few classes addressed this topic, and the career perspectives were mostly with big oil companies (or at least, that’s what I saw at that time).

Simply put, I was not enjoying my degree at all.

Feeling I was not going anywhere pursuing chemical engineering, I tried finding a new field.

A friend of mine was a web developer and he even had started his own web development company. He seemed successful and his passion for it inspired me to check it out.

Learning web development while university

So I set myself to learn web development while completing my bachelor’s in chemical engineering.

I first started reading MDN’s web development guide. I immediately fell in love with it. It was very dry, but I learned a lot while reading the documentation and trying things on my own.

However, I wanted to push my skills forward, so I took Colt Steele’s The Web Developer Bootcamp. I had read many great reviews about this course, and I thought it was worth paying a few dollars to try it out.

It turned out to be an amazing course! I absolutely enjoyed it and learned a great deal. I used the course to build a simple portfolio of small projects and…
