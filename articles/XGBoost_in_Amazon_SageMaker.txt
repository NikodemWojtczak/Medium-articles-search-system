XGBoost in Amazon SageMaker

What is SageMaker? SageMaker is Amazon Web Servicesâ€™ (AWS) machine learning platform that works in the cloud. It is fully-managed and allows one to perform an entire data science workflow on the platform. And in this post, I will show you how to call your data from AWS S3, upload your data into S3 and bypassing local storage, train a model, deploy an endpoint, perform predictions, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

The data cleaning and feature engineering code are derived from this blog post, which is written by Andrew Long, who gave full permission to use his code. The dataset can be found here.

Starting Your Notebook Instance

Head over to your AWS dashboard and find SageMaker, and on the left sidebar, click on `Notebook instances`. To create an instance, click the orange button that says `Create notebook instance`. Here you can choose the instance name, the instance type, elastic inference (scales your instance size according to demand and usage), and other security features. Unless you have specific security requirements from your company, I tend to leave those alone and just fill in the instance name. It will take a few minutes to launch, and after it successfully hosts the instance, AWS gives you two options to write your code in; Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Labs.

Importing Packages

Once you choose either one of the options, you will need to run some code to get your notebook ready.
