The Complete TensorFlow Tutorial for Newbies

TensorFlow is a robust framework for machine learning and deep learning. It makes it easier to build models and deploy them for production.

It is the most popular framework among developers. This comes with no surprise, as the framework is also available for web-based machine learning (TensorFlow.js) and for on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite). Furthermore, with the recent announcement of TensorFlow 2.0, the framework will soon be easier to use, as the syntax will be simplified with fewer APIs, and it will support the Julia programming language.

It is a great time to get started with TensorFlow, and mastering it is an important asset data scientists.

This tutorial will get you up and running with TensorFlow. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is not stable, so we will focus on the previous stable version.

We will first install the framework in the easiest way possible, then we will write a few functions to learn the syntax and to use a few APIs. Finally, we will write a model that will recognize hand signs.

Let’s get started!
