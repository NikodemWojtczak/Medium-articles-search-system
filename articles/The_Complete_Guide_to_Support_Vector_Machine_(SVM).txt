Understand its inner workings and implement SVMs in four different scenarios

What would we do without sklearn?

Introduction

We have seen how to approach a classification problem with logistic regression, LDA, and decision trees. Now, yet another tool is introduced for classification: support vector machine.

The support vector machine is a generalization of a classifier called maximal margin classifier. The maximal margin classifier is simple, but it cannot be applied to the majority of datasets, since the classes must be separated by a linear boundary.

That is why the support vector classifier was introduced as an extension of the maximal margin classifier, which can be applied in a broader range of cases.

Finally, support vector machine is simply a further extension of the support vector classifier to accommodate non-linear class boundaries.

It can be used for both binary or multiclass classification.

Explaining the theory of SVMs can get very technical. Hopefully, this article will make it easy to understand how SVMs work.

Once the theory is covered, you will get to implement the algorithm in four different scenarios!

Without further due, letâ€™s get to it.
