Introduction

We know that larger companies contain more than thousand employees working for them, so taking care of the needs and satisfaction of each employee is a challenging task to do, it results in valuable and talented employees leave the company without giving the proper reason.

Employee churn is a major problem for many firms these days. Great talent is scarce, hard to keep and in high demand. Given the well-known direct relationship between happy employees and happy customers, it becomes of utmost importance to understand the drivers of employee dissatisfaction.

This post emphasizes on predicting retention of an employee within an organization such that whether the employee will leave the company or continue with it. It uses the data of previous employees who have worked for the company and by finding a pattern it predicts the retention in the form of yes or no.

The parameters we are using, such as salary, number of years spent in the company, promotions, number of hours, work accident, financial background, etc. Through this paper, an organization can choose its strategies to keep great representatives from leaving the organization. The data has 14,999 examples (samples). Below are the features and the definitions of each one:

satisfaction_level: Level of satisfaction {0–1}.

last_evaluationTime: Time since last performance evaluation (in years).

number_project: Number of projects completed while at work.

average_montly_hours: Average monthly hours at the workplace.

time_spend_company: Number of years spent in the company.

Work_accident: Whether the employee had a workplace accident.

left: Whether the employee left the workplace or not {0, 1}.

promotion_last_5years: Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years.

sales: Department the employee works for.

salary: Relative level of salary {low, medium, high}.

Data Set

Data Preprocessing

The dataset has ‘salary’ and ‘sales’ column as categorical data, So we have to perform OneHotEncoding & LabelEncoding to convert this data into numerical form and To create dummy features we have to drop the first one to avoid linear dependency where some learning algorithms may struggle.

After that, we will split the data into training and testing datasets.

Regression Models

Because we want results in the form of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ such that whether an employee will leave the company or not, So the best suitable regression model is Logistic Regression for this dataset. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign.

To calculate the accuracy of the result our model has generated we will be going to use Confusion Matrix as an evaluation parameter.

Classifiers

A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition based on the attribute value. It partitions the tree in a recursive manner call recursive partitioning.

Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm. A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests create decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets a prediction from each tree and selects the best solution through voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.

Here in our dataset, we will use these two classifiers to classify our result in the form of Yes and No.

Conclusion

Factors affecting the employment

Here in the above graph numbers on x-axis from 0 to 6 are representing WithHigherProjects,WithLowerSalary,WithHigherTime,WithPromotion,WithWorkAccident,WithorNotWorkAccident,WithoutWorkAccident. Each of these are the factors which can affect employment as WithHigherTime represents, employees who have more than four year of work experience but still haven’t got any promotion is 1750 which is a significant amount, WithLowerSalary represents employees whose salary level is low even when their evaluation score was higher than 3 such employees are 750.

Thus after evaluating this dataset, we get to know that lower salary levels, no promotions even when employees are working more than 4 years are the two main reasons for the employees to leave the organization.
