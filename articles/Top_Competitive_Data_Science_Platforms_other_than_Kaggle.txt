The best way of to learn anything is by doing.

What do you do after you have completed hundreds of MOOCs, consumed thousands of books and notes, and listened to a million people rant about their experience in Data Science? You start applying the concepts. The only way to apply machine learning concepts is by getting your hands dirty. Either find some real-world problems in your area of interest or participate in Hackathons and Machine learning Competitions.

Competitive Data Science is not all about applying algorithms. An algorithm is essentially a tool, and anybody can use it by writing just a few lines of code. The main takeaway from participating in these competitions is that they provide a great learning opportunity. Of course, real-life problems are not necessarily the same as those provided in the competitions; still, these platforms enable you to apply your knowledge to processes and see how you fare compared to others.

Advantages of participating in Data Science Competitions

You have a lot to gain and practically nothing to lose by participating in these competitions. It has both tangible and intangible benefits like:

Great learning opportunity.

Getting exposed to state-of-the-art approaches and datasets.

Networking with like-minded people. Working in teams is even great since it helps to think over a problem from different perspectives.

Showcasing your talent to the world and a chance of getting recruited

It is also fun to participate and see how you fare on the leaderboard.

The prize is a bonus but shouldn’t be the sole criteria.

Kaggle is a well-known platform for Data Science competitions. It is an online community of more than 1,000,00 registered users consisting of both novice and expert. However, apart from Kaggle, there are other Data Mining Competition Platforms worth knowing and exploring. Here is a brief overview of some of…
