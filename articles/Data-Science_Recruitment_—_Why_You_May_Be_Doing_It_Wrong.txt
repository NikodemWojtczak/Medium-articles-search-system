In the last two and a half years, before my current position, when I was looking for a job, I had been interviewed by more than 50 companies. From small startups to corporations. I had managed to experience a wide range of interview types, from phone conversations to home assignments. Since then, I have had the pleasure of sitting in the other chair, interviewing about 20 candidates for a data-science (DS) position.

As a recruiter, I can't stress how important it is to use the right tools when interviewing candidates. Some examples come to mind, you shouldn't ask nitty-gritty statistical questions when your primary focus is machine-learning (ML), deep-learning (DL) or vice versa, you shouldn’t ask your candidates to ‘program’ on a piece of paper when you expect them to work in a notebook or an IDE and you shouldn't ask a potential manager to do probability riddles when you are interviewing for a managing position.

What I’m trying to communicate is that one size doesn't fit all! People come from different academic backgrounds and experiences. It's important to be prepared for a wide range of profiles. Otherwise, by using bad tools you will overlook really good candidates. The following are common mistakes that several of my colleagues and I have personally experienced.
