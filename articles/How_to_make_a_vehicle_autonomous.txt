How to make a vehicle autonomous

When thinking about autonomous vehicles we consider the idea of a car that can take us from origin to destination without the need for human intervention.

Various levels of autonomy have been defined by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers). Ranging from level 0 which are our daily-use utility vehicles, until level 5 which are vehicles where no human interaction is required. Currently, we are far from a level 5 automation since there are many situations in which autonomous vehicles are not good dealing with. But if the industry and academia keep the good work we might be there sooner than later. Once we get there our vehicles will have no steering wheels.

This article will address the enabling technologies that make a vehicle autonomous and how these technologies are integrated together to allow a car/truck/SUV to navigate streets autonomously.

First, letâ€™s imagine we have a car and we wish to make our car autonomous. There are three main elements this car will need to become self-driving, namely, HDMap (High Definition Map); State and geolocation estimator; and a motion manager. Before we jumped into addressing these key aspects of autonomous vehicles there are a few background concepts that we need to address, such as the sensors used in autonomous vehicles.

Sensors used in Autonomous Vehicles:

The following are some sensors used in Autonomous Vehicles :

LIDAR: Stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. This technology is used to scan roads and buildings. With a LIDAR scan, we generate a cloud point (literally a dataset of points) which can be loaded and used to represent the real world.
