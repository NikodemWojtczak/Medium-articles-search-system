So you’re thinking about attending a data science bootcamp? You’ve seen lists like this one saying that data scientist is the best job in America (and highly paid to boot) and you are constantly bombarded with ads about how Bootcamp ABC will train you and help you land your first data science offer.

It’s definitely a gamble to quit your current job, shell out somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000, go back to school for 3 months, and then job hunt for an undetermined amount of time post bootcamp.

Now that I have gone through the data science bootcamp experience and come out the other side, here is what I wish I had known about it and the ensuing job hunting process beforehand. Disclaimer: I attended Metis in San Francisco so if you choose another bootcamp and/or location, your experience may differ from mine.

You will learn a lot of cool things… but 70% of it will not be useful for landing your first job

Computer vision is super cool, so is text generation with an LSTM neural network. But there is a 99% chance that your interviewer will care much more about your SQL table joining skills than your knowledge and passion for deep learning.

Eyes blurry from too many SQL queries…

I’m not saying that deep learning and artificial intelligence are not important to know (they definitely are), but rather that you will probably be interviewing mostly for data analyst roles (or data analyst roles disguised with the data scientist title) when you first finish your bootcamp.

And as far as I can tell, the key skills that you need for these types of roles are:
