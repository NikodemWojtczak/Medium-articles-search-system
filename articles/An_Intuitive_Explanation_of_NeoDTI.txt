An Intuitive Explanation of NeoDTI

Introduction

In the previous stories of this series, we have discussed DeepWalk and GraphSAGE. Both of them were proposed to learn node representations in networks with a single entity and a single link type, i.e. homogenous networks. If you are unaware of these methods, you can check the previous stories.

In this story, we will explain NeoDTI [1], which has a different perspective. NeoDTI diverges from DeepWalk and GraphSAGE in two aspects. Firstly, NeoDTI is capable of operating on heterogeneous networks, i.e. networks with multiple link and entity types. Secondly, unlike DeepWalk and GraphSAGE, NeoDTI learns task-specific node embeddings, rather than general-purpose ones. In this manner, NeoDTI embeddings are specialized for a task, namely link prediction.

NeoDTI is proposed to utilize heterogeneous data for the drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task. In the DTI task, each drug and target is represented with a node and two nodes are adjacent if they are known to be interacting. Therefore, link prediction corresponds to predict whether a drug and a protein interact. Below we can see a toy heterogeneous network that consists of three drugs and four targets.

Although NeoDTI is proposed for DTI, link prediction on heterogeneous networks is a cross-domain problem. For instance, consider the Medium network where users and stories are represented as nodes. In this network, an edge between users denotes follower relation, whereas an edge between user and story denotes clapping. In this scenario, the link prediction task can be used for either friend or story recommendation to users.
