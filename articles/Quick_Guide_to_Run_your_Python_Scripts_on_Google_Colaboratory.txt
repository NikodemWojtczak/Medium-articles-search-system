If you are looking for an interactive way to run your Python script, say you want to start a machine learning project with a couple of friends, look no further â€” Google Colab is the best solution for you. You can work online and save your code on your local Google Drive, and it allows you to

Run your scripts with free GPUs (and TPUs!)

Utilize pre-installed Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook features

Work anywhere you want, it is on the clouds

Share codes and collaborate with colleagues

In short,

Google Colab = Jupyter Notebook + Free GPUs

with arguably cleaner interface than most (if not all) alternatives. I have come up with some code snippets for you to master Google Colab. I hope this becomes a go-to article when you need some ready-made codes to solve common problems on Colab.
