In July 1969, the Apollo 11 spaceflight launched and landed humans on the Moon. Fifty years later, some people believe that the Moon landings did not really happen.

This article looks at two recent survey estimates of the belief that the Moon landings were faked, and the differences between those two surveys.

True or false?

Back in February 2019, YouGov asked 2,039 British adults in its internet panel, for its podcast with Yahoo:

To what extent, if at all, do you think the following statement is true or false? The moon landing was staged

People could answer along a scale from definitely true to definitely false, or that they don’t know. The survey estimated that 16% believe it is probably (12%) or definitely true (4%) that the moon landing was staged.

A few weeks ago, Number Cruncher Politics — which is not a British Polling Council member— asked 1,000 British adults about several conspiracies. Respondents could tick all that they believed were true.

Previously, Number Cruncher Politics has used a mixture of internet panels and internet ‘river sampling’. River sampling involves inviting people to answer questions via promotional ads on selected websites.

In the survey, only 5% ticked “The moon landings between 1969 to 1972 were faked and humans have not really been to the moon”.

So, which is it: 5% or 16%?

Differences

There are some differences in wording, comparing ‘faked’ and ‘staged’, and specifying the time of multiple Moon landings.

However, the key difference is the response format.

In YouGov’s survey, people had to select an option for each statement: definitely true, probably true, probably false, definitely false, or don’t know. This is called the forced-choice format.

The Number Cruncher Politics survey was, as the article suggested, of the select-all-that-apply format. If you have taken surveys on the internet…
