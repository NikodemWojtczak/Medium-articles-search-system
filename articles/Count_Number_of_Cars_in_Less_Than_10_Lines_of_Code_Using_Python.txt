When travelling in a car as a kid, did you ever play a game where you counted the number of cars that passed by? That used to be my favourite game as a kid.

In this post, I will teach you how to build your own car counter program in just 10 lines of code using Python.

You will need to install the following python libraries if it is not already installed:

opencv-python

cvlib

matplotlib

tensorflow

keras

Here is the code to import the required python libraries, read an image from storage, perform object detection on the image, display the image with a bounding box and label about the detected objects, count the number of cars in the image and print it.
