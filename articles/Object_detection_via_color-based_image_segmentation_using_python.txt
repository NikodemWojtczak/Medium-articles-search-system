Getting started

If you already have jupyter notebook or an IDE with which you can run python & OpenCV installed, just skip to Execution.

Tools

Our hero today is Anaconda. a free open-source distribution that helps with installing different packages & sorts out their messes into isolated environments.

What Wikipediaâ€™s telling us about Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda. The Anaconda distribution is used by over 12 million users and includes more than 1400 popular data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Here are detailed tutorials on how to download Anaconda.

anaconda for Windows & anaconda for Linux.

Creating the environment

$ conda create -n myEnv python=3

Type y (for yes) when prompted to download the packages.

Some important terms

Contours

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along with the boundary), having the same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

Thresholds

Applying thresholding on a grayscale image makes it a binary image. You set a threshold value, in which all values below this threshold are turned to black and all values above go white.
