Kubeflow Components and Pipelines

I want to keep things simple therefore we cover components, pipelines, and experiments. With pipelines and components, you get the basics that are required to build ML workflows.

There are many more tools integrated into Kubeflow and I will cover them in the upcoming posts.

Kubeflow is originated at Google.

Making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.

pipelines and experiments inside of a Notebook. Easy to understand and ready to use examples.

Pipelines

Component

Code that performs one step in the Pipeline. In other words a containerized implementation of an ML task.

A component is analog to a function, it has a name, parameter, return values, and a body. Each component in a pipeline executes independently and has to be packed as a docker image.

The components.

Graph

The representation between the components. It shows the steps your pipeline is executing.

The graph.

Pipeline

A pipeline describes the machine learning workflow, it includes the components and the graph.
