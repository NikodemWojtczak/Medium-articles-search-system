4 Steps to Break Into Data Science in 2020

2020 is almost here, which means it’s that time of the year when you take a piece of paper and make a list of goals you want to accomplish in the next year. Dario Radečić · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 6 min read · Dec 30, 2019 -- 1 Share

Nothing wrong with that, but you probably know that it’s very easy to make an exhaustive list of near-impossible, time-consuming goals that will only make you feel overwhelmed, and very likely not motivated — because there’s so much to do.

If you’re planning to enroll in data science in the next year, I’d say you’ve made a great decision. The field is widely accepted, there are jobs everywhere, salaries are great, and even the management is slowly figuring out why data science is needed.

But before we start, let me to slightly demotivate you (yes, it’s necessary) — one year isn’t enough to learn the entire field.

Don’t get me wrong, 1 year is enough for you to land your first job, but the chances are you won’t go from 0 to data science team lead in a year (if you manage to do so please share your story in the comment section).

With that being said, let’s explore all the skills you’ll need and how to learn just enough of them to get you started.

1. Brushing up the Math skills

You’ve most likely heard of harsh math prerequisites of data science. The amount of math you’ll need to know will vary much depending on the job role, but as a general answer to how much math you will need to get started, I would say: less than you think.
