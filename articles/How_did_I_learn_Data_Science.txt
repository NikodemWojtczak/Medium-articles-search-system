Member-only story How did I learn Data Science?

I am a Mechanical engineer by education. And I started my career with a core job in the steel industry.

But I didn’t like it and so I left that.

I made it my goal to move into the analytics and data science space somewhere around in 2013. From then on, it has taken me a lot of failures and a lot of efforts to shift.

Now, people on social networks ask me how I got started in the data science field. So I thought of giving a definitive answer.

It is not really impossible to do this but it will take a lot of time and effort. Fortunately, I had an ample supply of both.

Given below is the way that I took, and any aspiring person could choose to become a self-trained data scientist.

Some of the courses are not the same I did since some of them don’t exist and some have been merged into bigger specializations. But I have tried to keep it as similar to my experience as possible.

Also, I hope that you don’t lose hope after seeing the long list. You have to start with one or two courses. The rest will follow with time. Remember we have ample time.

Follow in order. I have tried to include everything that comes to my mind, including some post links which I think could be beneficial.

Introduction to Probability and Statistics

Stat 110: The quintessential Probability and Statistics course you gotta take. All the lectures and notes are available on Youtube and his site for free. On another note, you can also take this course from UC San Diego if you are looking for a verified certificate and an ongoing course. I am doing this as part of a MicroMasters Specialization in Data Science.

So back to STAT110. You should take this course, if not for the content then for Prof. Joseph Blitzstein sense of humor. The above picture is a testament to that.
