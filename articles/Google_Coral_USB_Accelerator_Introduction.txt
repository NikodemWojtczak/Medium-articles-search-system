Google Coral USB Accelerator Introduction

Last year at the Google Next conference Google announced that they are building two new hardware products around their Edge TPUs. Their purpose is to allow edge devices like the Raspberry Pi or other microcontrollers to exploit the power of artificial intelligence applications such as image classification and object detection by allowing them to run inference of pre-trained Tensorflow Lite models locally on their own hardware. This is not only more secure than having a cloud server which serves machine learning request but it also can reduce latency quite a bit.

The Coral USB Accelerator

The Coral USB Accelerator comes in at 65x30x8mm, making it slightly smaller than its competitor, the Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick. At first, this doesn’t seem like a big deal, but if you consider that the Intel Stick tends to block nearby USB ports making it hard to use peripherals, it makes quite a difference.

The Coral USB Accelerator comes in at 60€ (previously 75€) and can be ordered through websites, including:

On the hardware side, it contains an Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which provides fast inference for deep learning models at comparably low power consumption.

The USB Accelerator work with one of the following operating systems:

Linux Debian 10 or a derivative thereof (such as Ubuntu 18.04 or Raspbian)

macOS, with either MacPorts or Homebrew installed

Windows 10

It works best when connected over USB 3.0 even though it can also be used with USB 2.0 and therefore, can also be used with a microcontroller like the Raspberry Pi 3, which doesn’t offer any USB 3 ports.

Setup
