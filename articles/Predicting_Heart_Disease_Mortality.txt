Predicting Heart Disease Mortality

According to the Center for Disease Control, “About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.” It is unlikely anyone reading this hasn’t been affected by this disease in some way. I, myself, lost a family member to the disease at just 57 years old earlier this year. The causes are well documented and understood, yet it remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Is it possible that changes in public policy can help save lives in this regard?

By building a machine learning model to predict heart disease mortality rates across states, we should be able to identify states that have effectively reduced those rates. If so, the hope is that we can extrapolate and export those policy principles to other states.

Historical Data

The CDC publishes data on heart mortality and other leading causes of death every year going back to 1999. By tracking the number of deaths relative to the population of each state, we can see that mortality rates have been trending downward in the last 20 years.

As we can see, the trend seems to level out in 2011, likely due to an aging population.

Leading Causes of Heart Disease

After conducting some general research, four primary factors were identified that have a substantial impact on heart disease:

By running a simple linear regression with each predictor variable with the target, we can start to get a sense of which factors have the most significant impact.

From here, we can see that population demographics seem to have the largest impact…
