How can technology be a positive force in addressing the expected job losses due to Automation and Artificial Intelligence?

According to one study, millions of workers will likely need to change occupations in the next decade, 2–14% of the global workforce depending on the speed of adoption of automation/AI.

If you are in one of the job types charted below (from The Economist about the impact of AI Globally), and you are currently rolling burritos, re-siding buildings or cleaning houses, the path may be steep to obtain jobs at less risk of replacement by automation.

This begs the question as to how a level of optimism could spread into sectors of the U.S. population which are expected to be the most highly impacted economically by automation and AI, based on this McKinsey report:

“We measured job displacement as a percentage of jobs potentially lost due to automation by 2030 and found that because of their concentration in occupations at risk of automation, African Americans have one of the highest rates of potential job displacement when compared with other groups. “This translates to “a potential loss of approximately 132,000 African American jobs due to automation by 2030.”

These challenges may be higher for men than for women. The McKinsey paper notes that African American women, for example, have higher participation in K-12 education, nursing and other caregiving professions, which gives them greater access to the projected job growth in the healthcare and education sectors. These jobs “have a lower automation potential due to the need for dynamic, physical motions and deep…
