There are just too many things that we can do right now.

It is up to us to decide which things need our immediate attention, and how we can discard everything else from our attention.

At least for the time being, as it is just more productive and better for our own sanity.

It is physically impossible for us to be in New York and in Singapore at the same time.

We all know and full-heartedly admit that. Still, when it comes to our goals, and the things we want in life, we simply tend to forget exactly that.

Or at least we are not aware that we are even doing it.

We want to do X, Y, and Z at the same time, where each of these is not even remotely connected to one another.

I believe this comes to our tendency to get attracted to many things and believe that we can and need to do all of them.

We may want to master data science, and at the same time, we want to build an awesome productivity app with React Native that gets 3 million downloads. And during the weekend we also want to master blockchain and be the best developer out there.

All of these may seem as noble attempts and that we may want to become helpful for society. We may intend to invest time in things that we consider as worthwhile and master multiple skills at the same time.

But this is something really difficult to accomplish.

We may already notice the decline of the quality in all of those areas. We are even not content with our results, nor with the degradation that our life has experienced as a result of being spread-out.

We can notice the slow progress, and the growth in those different areas does not seem to pass the nasty threshold.

The truth is, we may be just dabbling.

We are afraid to go and master something that is really important.

Something that we see as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, which we really like and believeâ€¦
