Are you bored of doing same stuff again? Feeling your life is just doing the same thing over and over again?

Here is the thing, today I am going to introduce a tool to automate your BORING stuff — Python. Python is perhaps the most easiest language to learn. Because of your acquired Python skill, you will be able not only to increase your productivity, but also focus on work which you will be more interested in.

Get Rid of boring stuff using Python is a series so click this link to view the whole series!

Let’s get started!

I will use an example, paper trading in Singapore stock market as an illustration on how automation could be done. Paper trading allow you to practice investing or trading using virtual money before you really put real money in it. This is a good way to start as to prove whether your strategy works.

This is the agenda which I will be sharing:

Part 1 — Input the stock code and amount which you want trade in a text file.

Part 2 — How to do Web Scraping on your own, the full journey.

Part 3 — Clean and tabulate data.

Part 4— Output the result into a csv or excel file.

Follow the whole journey and you will notice how simple it is to automate your boring stuff and to update your price IN 5 Seconds.
