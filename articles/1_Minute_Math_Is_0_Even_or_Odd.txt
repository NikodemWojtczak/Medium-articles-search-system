A question, that my students frequently ask me is: Is 0 even or odd or both?

Is 0 even?

To answer this question, we first need to define what “even” means.

An even number is a number n which can be written as n=2⋅ k for some whole number k.

That means if we divide an even number by 2, there is no rest left!

Can we write 0=2⋅ k for some k? Yepp, we can if we choose k=0.

Awesome. That means that 0 is even!

Is 0 also odd?

Again, we first need to define what “odd” means and the common definition is very similar to the definition of even.

An odd number is a number n which can be written as n=2⋅ k+1 for some whole number k.

Can we write 0=2⋅k+1 for some whole number k? Nope. We can’t because solving this equation for k yields k=-1/2, which is not a whole number.

The Answer

Alright, the proof is done. 0 is even (and only even!).

Not even (pun intended) too difficult, is it?
