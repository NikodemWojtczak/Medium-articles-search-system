Clearing the Water Around A.I.

Nearly everyone today has been experiencing some effects and new ideas about artificial intelligence. Most companies, banks, retail stores, etc, are focusing on ways artificial intelligence will expand their market and lead them to more successful ventures. I’m sure you’ve all once had or heard a conversation with people, with no technical knowledge about artificial intelligence, apprehensively talking about how their lives are going to be changed by it. I’m sitting in this hole in the wall breakfast place by Wall Street writing this and experiencing it right now. Just picture a couple of classic NYC execs talking about the A.I. strategies they’ve started implementing at their firm; “It’s going far better than we assumed, I’ve got no clue what’s going on, I just hope we’ll be able to start making staff cuts ASAP”.

Numerous startups today are trying to slap A.I. right on their face, aiming, and usually succeeding, to generate large amounts of funding. There is this large investment into a field that people see as today’s ‘Gold Rush’, but there lays a murky public understanding of how it functions (pun intended).

ALGORITHMS ARE THE LEGOS

“An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions so explicit even something as literal-minded as a computer can follow them.”

By itself, other than impressing or intimidating people just from the sound of it, an algorithm alone is no smarter than a power saw. (A.I. solving power saw kickbacks with Destin, SmarterEveryDay)

Try and think of something that just does one thing extremely well, over and over again. It’s very useful for sorting lists of numbers or searching the internet for pictures of the mother of dragons.
