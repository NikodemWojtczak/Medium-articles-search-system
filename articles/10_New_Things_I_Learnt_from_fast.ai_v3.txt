Everyone’s talking about the fast.ai Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), so I decided to have a go at their 2019 deep learning course Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3.

I’ve always known some deep learning concepts/ideas (I’ve been in this field for about a year now, dealing primarily with computer vision) but never really understood some intuitions or explanations. The course instructors Jeremy Howard, Rachel Thomas and Sylvain Gugger (follow them on Twitter!) are influential people in the deep learning sphere (Jeremy has a lot of experience with Kaggle competitions), so I hope to gain intuitions, new insights, and some tips and tricks for model training from them. I have so much to learn from these folks.

So here I am after 3 weeks of watching the videos (I didn’t do any exercises 🤫🤫🤫🤫) and writing this post to compartmentalise the new things I learnt to share with you. There were, of course, some things I was clueless about, so I did a little bit more research on them and presented them in this article. Towards the end, I also write about how I felt about the course (spoiler alert: I love it ❣️).

Disclaimer: Different people gather different learning points, depending on your deep learning background. This post is not recommended for beginners of deep learning and is not a summary of the course contents. Instead, this post assumes you have basic knowledge of neural networks, gradient descent, loss functions, regularisation techniques and generating embeddings. Some experience of the following would be great too: image classification, text classification, semantic segmentation and generative adversarial networks.

I organised the content of my 10 learning points as such: from the theory of neural networks to architectures, to things related to loss function (learning rate, optimiser), to model training (and regularisation), to deep learning tasks and finally, model interpretability.
