An enormous part of data science is a subset of data science called Data Engineering. Data Engineering(DE) involves pipe-lining, administrating, and end-pointing data in various formats. The great news is with Lathe 0.0.7 we can very easily design a model and predict with pipelines. There are going to be future improvements on this mostly basic version. But for now, it certainly will be a very useful tool, and its honestly incredible how easy it is to do. I look forward to expanding the package further and further.

Today I’m going to show off Julia, Lathe, JLD2 and Genie for making their way into pipeline building.

In order to train a model, we need data. I found this cool data-set on Kaggle, so I decided to give it a go. Now that we have a data-set, we can read it into Julia:

using CSV

df = CSV.read("Summary of Weather.csv")

After a quick glance, I selected three different features that I thought would be easy to track and make sense of. First I decided to limit each date stamp to just the year with Dates and DataFrames:

using DataFrames

using Dates

df.Date = [i = DateTime(i) for i in df.Date]

df.Date = [i = year(i) for i in df.Date]

And then extract those features I talked about:

df = DataFrame(:Date => df.Date,:Precipitation => df.Precip,:Temp => df.MeanTemp)

Aside from the the other features, these were actually relatively clean, with no missing values. Now that we’ve got three features, and still no idea what to pick for the target, we should probably do some statistical tests! While this wouldn’t be vital for a model like Multiple Linear Regression, we don’t have it in Lathe just yet.
