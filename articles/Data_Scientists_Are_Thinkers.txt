Member-only story Data Scientists Are Thinkers

Data scientists serve a very technical purpose, but one that is vastly different from other individual contributors. Unlike engineers, designers, and project managers, data scientists are exploration-first, rather than execution-first.

This isn’t a surprise when you consider the origin of data science. If you quickly look over the early history of the field, you see that things got started with academics researching the possibilities of computational statistics. This researcher-like mindset is still embedded in our DNA.

We are constantly surrounded by data that represents the business, product, and customers at scale. This allows us to see things from a 30,000-foot view, where other roles spend most of their time at ground-level, working on execution. It’s important that we realize this fact, and more important that we make the most of it.

Execution vs. exploration

Most technical ICs within established companies focus on execution. This is pretty intuitive. In order for a company to be successful, it has to get things done that provide value.

Data science roles are a little different. They vary greatly depending on the team structure and size, but generally speaking, execution isn’t where we’re at our best. Our most valuable work often comes from exploration.

When it comes to complex questions and hypotheses, execution isn’t the answer. Someone has to dive in and figure things out on a deeper level. They have to thoroughly analyze and explore the problem. Data scientists are the perfect candidates to take this on.

The act of thinking, coming up with a hunch, and then exploring that hunch is criminally underrated. When done right, not only does this work produce interesting results — it drives decision-making. This is where data scientists really thrive.

If you look at where certain roles end up on the execution-exploration spectrum, you get something like this:
