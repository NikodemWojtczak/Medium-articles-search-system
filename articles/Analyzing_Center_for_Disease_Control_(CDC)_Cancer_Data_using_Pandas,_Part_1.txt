While research in cancer drug development and treatment has progressed over the years, cancer continues to claim the lives of thousands of people every year. Despite this, the potential for progress in cancer research continues to grow with increasing access to data, compute power, and state of the art machine learning tools.

In this post we will explore the Center for Disease Control Cancer Dataset. The dataset includes information on brain tumors, cancer types by states, race, age, and much more. In this post we will explore the ‘BRAINBYSITE.TXT’ data.

We begin by importing the pandas library and reading in the ‘.TXT’ file into a pandas data frame. Each column is separated by ‘|’, so we also set the separation parameter ‘sep’ appropriately. Lets also specify which columns we are interested in analyzing and display the first five rows of data to get a feel for the column types and values:

df = pd.read_csv("BRAINBYSITE.TXT", sep="|")

df = df[['AGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'COUNT', 'POPULATION', 'SEX', 'YEAR', 'SITE"]]

print(df.head())

The ‘COUNT’ column contains some missing values which we can remove:

df = df[df['COUNT'] != '~']

df.reset_index(inplace=True)

print(df.head())

To start our analysis we can generate a histogram of the ‘COUNT’ column to visualize the distribution in tumors across all categories:

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #settings for the histogram plot

sns.set(font_scale = 2)

plt.ylim(0, 80)

plt.xlim(0, 10000) df['COUNT'] = df['COUNT'].astype(int)

df['COUNT'].hist(bins=1000)

Distribution in Tumor Counts

We can also look at the histogram for the number of tumors for females and males on an overlaid plot:
