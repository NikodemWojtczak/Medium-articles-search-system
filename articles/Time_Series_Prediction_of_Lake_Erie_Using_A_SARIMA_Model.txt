Executive Summary:

Constructed a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ( SARIMA ) model to track for monthly water levels in Lake Erie for five decades.

( ) model to track for monthly water levels in Lake Erie for five decades. Provided a pipeline of selecting Time Series models using the following techniques: spectral analysis, differencing, AIC, PACF, and various robustness checks.

The model predicts results accurately, after cross-validating with the real data.

Unlike other types of statistical models, Time Series models assume dependent observations and argue yesterday's influences today in a meaningful way. In this post, I train a SARIMA model to predict the monthly water levels in Lake Erie. I’ll walk through the pipeline, explaining what to do and why we do it.

Load, Clean, and Transform The Dataset

#load the raw dataset

mydata<-read.csv(“monthly-lake-erie-levels-1921–19.csv”)

mydata_new<-mydata[-601,]#remove the last blank row

Lake_Erie_Levels_ts<-ts(mydata_new$Monthly.Lake.Erie.Levels.1921…1970,frequency = 12,start=c(1921,1))#turn into a TS model

# Plot the Dependent Variable

plot(Lake_Erie_Levels_ts,xlab=”Date”,ylab=”Levels”,

main=”Figure 1: Monthly Lake Erie Levels from 1921 to 1970")

As a rule of thumb, we should eyeball the raw data for outliers, trend, seasonality, and sharp discontinuity.

From Figure 1, data points move up and down within a certain range, suggesting constant variance.

The mean moves along with the horizontal line (time) regularly every 12 lags, indicating a cyclical pattern. We will do a spectral analysis to determine the exact seasonality.
