The Rise of the Term “MLOps”

“MLOps (a compound of Machine Learning and “information technology OPerationS”) is [a] new discipline/focus/practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and information technology (IT) professionals while automating and productizing machine learning algorithms.” — Nisha Talagala (2018)

For folks interested, I’ll also be teaching a Machine Learning in Production class in 2022–23!

The understanding of the machine learning lifecycle is constantly evolving. When I first saw graphics illustrating this “cycle” years ago, the emphasis was on the usual suspects (data prep and cleaning, EDA, modeling etc…). Less notice was given to the more elusive and less tangible final state — often termed “deployment”, “delivery” or in some cases just “prediction”.

At the time, I don’t think a lot of rising data scientists really considered the sheer scope of that last term (I sure as hell didn’t). “Prediction” didn’t just mean .predict() , it implied true scale, production-level deployment, monitoring and updating — a true cycle. Without the engineering skills needed to make this vague concept reality, the data scientist was stuck in the notebook. Models lived as .pickle files on a data scientist’s local machine, performance was reported with Powerpoint, and the ML lifecycle was broken.

A Straightforward, but Incomplete Data Science Lifecycle with the word “Modeling” spelled incorrectly

While the end-to-end ML lifecycle has always been pitched as an actual “cycle”, to date there has been limited success in actually managing this end-to-end process at enterprise level scale for what I see as the following reasons:
