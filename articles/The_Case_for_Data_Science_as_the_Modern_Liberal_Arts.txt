The Case for Data Science as the Modern Liberal Arts

The liberal arts bring together insights from various fields and data. That’s exactly what modern data science requires of us. Alexander Titus · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Aug 11, 2019 -- Share

Liberal arts education has been around for a long time. Back in a time when our understanding of natural phenomena was limited, it took integrated training across the arts, sciences, and humanities to be able to make sense of the world. As we began to understand more about specific fields, we required more depth of expertise to make advances in that field.

Modern science has moved back toward benefiting from a liberal arts education. It’s why data science should be considered as the modern liberal arts. The breadth of expertise required of data scientists is often criticized as the kind of training that simply can’t exist. In reality, however, the liberal arts have provided broad integrated education to young minds around the world, and modern data science is the emergence of a new form of liberal arts careers.

The demands of being a data scientist

Data science has been widely accepted as one of the hottest jobs of the 21st century. To be good at your job, you’re expected to be an expert in computer science, statistics, data engineering, data visualization, executive presentations, and persuasive writing. The world is flustered at all the expectations, largely because they expect “expertise” in all of that. What the technical world is coming to terms with is that when you have such breadth of application, you end up not knowing where to apply your skills. Similarly, when you are presented with an abundance of data, you have to systematically cull through it all to make sense of it.

Liberal arts education has been teaching breadth and synthesis for decades
