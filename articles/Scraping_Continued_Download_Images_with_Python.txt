A week or so ago I wrote an article on web scraping. The article covered some basic concepts of fetching data with Python’s BeautifulSoup library, and furthermore utilized the power of Pandas to store fetched data into a DataFrame object.

Going through that article is a prerequisite for this one, because how else will you get the data? You don’t have to read through it if you are already familiar with concepts of web scraping, just grab the code at the bottom. Anyhow, here’s a link to it:

If you are among the ones who read the article, you might be wondering is that’s it to the entire story (spoiler alert: it’s not).

Just a quick look at the fetch data and you will see the majestic Thumbnail column, and if you connect that with the title of this article, it’s not hard to conclude the story isn’t over just yet.

Today’s article will deal with the process of downloading images from the thumbnail URLs.

But why would I want to download images?

I’m glad you’ve asked. Maybe your data science project requires image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks. Let’s imagine the following scenario — you want to develop an algorithm which will be able to predict the book topic (genre) based on some thumbnail image characteristics (huh, actually a good project idea!).

I’m by no means an expert in CNNs, but I will show you how to download images into their respective subdirectories based on the genre. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

A Little Bit of Prep Work

You really thought that you would get away without this?
