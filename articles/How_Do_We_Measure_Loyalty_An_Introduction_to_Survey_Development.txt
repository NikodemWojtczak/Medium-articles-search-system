Attempting to “measure loyalty” sounds so crazy that only Dwight Schrute would say it, but it’s something that marketing researchers do all the time. In this post, we will cover the basics of exploring the results of a self-reported survey to uncover what “latent” factors may be reflected in the survey’s items.

This is a common technique in social science fields like psychology, marketing, and organizational behavior, where the concept of interest is likely not directly measurable.

PsychometRics

Often this type of research is conducted in proprietary social science tools like SPSS or MPlus, but we will be using R for this analysis. First, we will install all necessary packages and load two data frames: brand_loyalty , which contains the survey results, and brand_loyalty_items , which tells us a little more about each item in the survey.

# Download survey responses brand_loyalty <- read.csv(" https://cwru.box.com/shared/static/naelh1otw6dlsavj8jwnfmr021680xgk.csv ") # Item description and proposed dimensions

stringsAsFactors = FALSE) brand_loyalty_items <- read.csv(" https://cwru.box.com/shared/static/0qvuvuu47hmq75mi0ljl8qo7p29hs472.csv ",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

Anatomy of a survey

Before we get started with analyzing the data, it’s a good idea to look at the survey as the respondents saw it. Here we see ten “items" related to the concept of brand loyalty. Respondents indicate their level of agreement with each item on a scale of 1 to 5. This rating system is known as a Likert scale, after its developer, social scientist Rensis Likert.

Let’s get to know our responses through exploratory data analysis (EDA), then we can jump into how we can use them to measure loyalty.
