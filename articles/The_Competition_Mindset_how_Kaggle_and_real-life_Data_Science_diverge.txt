The Competition Mindset: how Kaggle and real-life Data Science diverge

Major thanks to Rachael and Will from Kaggle for reviewing and providing recommendations on this article.

TLDR: Kaggle competitions are great for Machine Learning education. But it can set wrong expectations about what to expect in real-life business setting. I go through 3 ways Data Science in industry environment is different from competitions, and how it’s is important to align expectations with the reality of a Data Science job.

Intro: The Competition Mindset

Kaggle is a very popular platform that’s great for aspiring Data Scientists to pick up skills on applied Machine Learning: preprocessing, pipelining, algorithm optimization. However, I believe it can also impact those trying to understand and learn real-world Data Science. By real-world, I strictly mean real-life industry setting where Data Science is adopted to meet business aims.

Many career-seekers are currently trying to break into the Data Science field. Some look at Kaggle competitions to jumpstart and guide their new ML journey. Given this trend, I believe that it is critical to distinguish what Kaggle competition is and what it is not. While Kaggle has great educational benefits, I believe that it can also develop what I call the Competition Mindset.

The Competition Mindset: (noun) the mindset that techniques, objectives, and processes prioritized in Kaggle competitions reflect those in a typical business environment.

The biggest challenge with this mindset is that there are core fundamental differences between Data Science used in Kaggle competitions and that practiced in an industry setting (what I call Industry Data Science). I will go into three specific reasons why this is the…
