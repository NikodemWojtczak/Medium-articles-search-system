A Round of Applause for Algorithms

Foreign language. Black and white. No-name cast. This is the perfect storm of descriptives to turn me off a film. But, Netflix matched it to me with a score in the 90s.

Although the online streaming behemoth is privy to all my dirty viewing secrets (full disclosure: superheroes and space wars), so am I. And I would not have opted for Roma of my own volition. But, Netflix was presuming to know something about me that not even I did. So I gave Roma a go. I was not disappointed.

Now I don’t profess to understand the inner magic behind algorithms. I suppose the in-the-know crowd is a pretty elite club of tech wizards. But there is one thing that I do get. Algorithms power machine learning and deep learning tools that make it possible to process and analyze an infinite set of data points. Something impossible for my brain, your brain, and even Einstein’s brain to fathom. And the trove of data Netflix amassed from my addictive binging habits, and then plugged into its algorithms indicated I would like Roma. Something even I was not aware of.

And for a lot of people, this is terrifying.
