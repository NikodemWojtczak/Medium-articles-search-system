In Boston, it feels like you can’t walk more than a block without seeing a Starbucks. In fact, within about a one mile radius of Stax’s Boston office in any direction, we have 15(!) Starbucks locations.

Given this, it’s natural to ask: How does Starbucks think about location selection?

At a broader level, what can their store locations tell us about their customer base and what they view as attractive locations to serve this base? Can we infer at a high level where they should or will explore further store expansion?

By analyzing store data and how that maps to Census demographics, we can create a high-level “profile” of what Starbucks has deemed to be a valuable location, in addition to seeing where there may be opportunity to further expand footprint in and around these areas.

We’ll begin the analysis by grounding ourselves in an overall view of stores in the U.S.

Note: Each dot represents one Starbucks location and darker regions means more stores. Data is as of 2017 and will not include more recent openings.

Visually, we can see a bias toward the coasts and major metropolitan areas, all of which make sense given the context of being an upscale mass-market brand seeking consumers that can pay slightly premium prices.
