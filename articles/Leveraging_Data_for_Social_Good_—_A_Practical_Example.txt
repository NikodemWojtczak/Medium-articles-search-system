Using Data Science to make common lives better

NOTE: All terminology and theory that has been the backbone of our team’s studies on this project are attributed to the preparatory workshop conducted by the Live in Labs Team at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India.

In the summer of 2018, I had an opportunity to be a part of a team that visited a highly backward village in Northern India. This visit was a part of our curriculum at the college — The Live in Labs Program(Read more about it here) and our task for the program was as follows :

Identify a Key Indicator in the village that needed immediate attention, validate our find and propose a solution that would help improve the state of the same.

Through this blog post, I shall provide a gist of our work at the village and elucidate how I was able to put to use, my love for data science in doing social good.

All the code that I have written for this project can be found at https://github.com/ry05/Live-in-Labs-Analysis.
