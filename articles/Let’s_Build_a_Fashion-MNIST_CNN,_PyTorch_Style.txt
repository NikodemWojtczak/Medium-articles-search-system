When it comes to frameworks in technology, one interesting thing is that from the very beginning, there always seems to be a variety of choices. But over time, the competitions will evolve into having only two strong contenders left. Cases in point being ‘PC vs Mac’, ‘iOS vs Android’, ‘React.js vs Vue.js’, etc. And now, we have ‘PyTorch vs TensorFlow’ in machine learning.

TensorFlow, backed by Google, is undoubtedly the front-runner here. Released in 2015 as an open-source machine learning framework, it quickly gained a lot of attention and acceptance, especially in industries where production readiness and deployment is key. PyTorch is introduced much later by Facebook in 2017 but quickly gaining a lot of love from practitioners and researchers because of its dynamic computational graph and ‘pythonic’ style.
