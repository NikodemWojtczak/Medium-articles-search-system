If you work in market research, you probably also have to deal with survey data. Often these are available as SAV or SPSS files. SPSS is great for statistic analysis of survey data because variables, variable labels, values, and value labels are all integrated in one dataset. With SPSS, categorized variables are easy to analyze:

Unfortunately, SPSS is slow on larger data sets and the macro system for automation is not intuitive and offers just a few options compared to Python. Therefore I would like to show you how to analyze survey data with Python.

Setup

First of all, we install the pyreadstat module, which allows us to import SPSS files as DataFrames pip install pyreadstat . If you want to install it manually, you can download the package here:

Reading The Data

Now we import the module into a Jupyter notebook and load the dataset:

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import pyreadstat df, meta = pyreadstat.read_sav('...path\\Surveydata.sav')

df.head(5)

Letâ€™s take a look at the DataFrame:

We can not read out much from this, because we do not know what the variables and the numerical information mean. The meta container includes all other data, such as the labels and value labels. With meta.column_labels we can print the variable labels:
