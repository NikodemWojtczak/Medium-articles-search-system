How to query and calculate Google Universal Analytics data in BigQuery

When I first started querying Google Analytics data in BigQuery, I had a hard time interpreting the ‘raw’ hit-level data hiding in the ga_sessions_ export tables. Because I could not find a noob-proof guide on how to calculate Google Analytics metrics in BigQuery, I decided to write one myself. I provide lots of example queries so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel and hopefully you can save yourself some valuable time.

Update: do you enjoy this article? Then you’ll also like my new website GA4BigQuery.com: a digital guide with tips, ideas, example queries and tutorials on how to query Google Analytics data in BigQuery & rock your digital marketing analytics.

I’ve migrated most example queries from this article to the new website, as it is easier to maintain all content in one place. This article will stay online to refer you to the right place.

I also published an article about querying Google Analytics 4 (previously App + Web) event data in BigQuery. This content will be migrated to GA4BigQuery.com too.
