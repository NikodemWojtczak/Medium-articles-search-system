How Everything in python is Object?

Strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are objects. everything is an object in the sense that it can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function.

Anything you can (legally) place on the right-hand side of the equals sign is (or creates) an object in Python.

> def hello():

print("say hello") > hi = hello() > hi()

"say hello" >hello()

"say hello"

Objects:

An Identity(id) A value(mutable or immutable)

Mutable: When you alter the item, the id is still the same. Ex: Dictionary, List

Immutable: String, Integer, tuple
