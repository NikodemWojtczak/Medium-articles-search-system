The demand for machine learning systems has soared over the past few years. This is majorly due to the success of Machine Learning techniques in a wide range of applications. AutoML is fundamentally changing the face of ML-based solutions today by enabling people from diverse backgrounds to use machine learning models to address complex scenarios. However, even with a clear indication that machine learning can provide a boost to certain businesses, a lot of companies today struggle to deploy ML models.

This is because there is a shortage of experienced and seasoned data scientists in the industry. In a way, the demand for machine learning experts has outpaced the supply. Secondly, a lot of machine learning steps require more experience than knowledge, especially when deciding which models to train and how to evaluate them. Such gaps are pretty apparent today, and a lot of efforts are being taken to address these issues. Automated Machine learning may be an answer to such impediments, and in this article, we shall understand in-depth how that can be achieved.

Automated Machine Learning: AutoML

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML tends to automate the maximum number of steps in an ML pipeline — with a minimum amount of human effort — without compromising the model’s performance.

Aspects of Automated Machine Learning

Automated machine learning can be thought of as the standard machine learning process with the automation of some of the steps involved. AutoML very broadly includes:
