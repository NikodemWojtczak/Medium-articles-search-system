The Chinese Idiom Chains Game

This is a classical education game that helps pupils learn idioms. Seated in a round table, a pupil comes up with a random Chinese idiom (a Chinese idiom consists of 4 Chinese characters). The next pupil must quickly say another idiom whose first character matches the last character of the given idiom. When someone gets stuck, he must sing a song or perform a dance.

Now with the knowledge of graph DB, a pupil can stop worrying about losing the game and having to perform in front of the class!

Graph Design

The graph structure is as simple as you can imagine. We have one types of node and one types of directed edge. It’s tempting to create a node for each idiom, because an idiom is an entity, just like a user, a movie, a product. If an edge exists between two nodes, we just create an edge. For example, there is an edge pointing from 坚定不移 to 移花接木, because the character 移 connects the two idioms.

Naive design

Someone from a relational DB background might naturally come up with this design, because an edge is simply a match in a JOIN operation. Right?Unfortunately, this seemingly innocuous design turned out to be impractical. We have to exhaustively search for all edges and add them one at a time, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

We can do much better with clever modeling. What if we embed the idiom in edges, instead of…
