Not so long ago!

Do you remember the time when data was sent to you in an external hard drive for your analysis or model building.

Now — as a data scientist, you are not limited to those means. There are several ways of storing data, sharing data as well as different sources to acquire data, augment data.

Below, I’m listing down several ways of gathering data for your analysis

Table of contents:

CSV file Flat File (tab, space, or any other separator) Text File (In a single file — reading data all at once) ZIP file Multiple Text Files (Data is split over multiple text files) Download File from Internet (File hosted on a server) Webpage (scraping) APIs (JSON) Text File (Reading data line by line) RDBMS (SQL Tables)

In Python, a file is characterized as either text or binary, and the difference between the two is important

Text files are structured as sequence of lines. Each line is terminated with a special character called EOL or End of line character. There are several types but most common are

or ,

A Binary file type is basically any type of file that’s not a text file. Because of their nature, binary file can only be processed by an application that know or understand the file’s structure

1. CSV File

Most common format for storing and sharing dataset is comma separated format or a csv file. pandas.read_csv() is THE most useful and powerful method and I strongly recommend you to read its documentation . By using appropriate kind of sep you can load several types of data in dataframe

import pandas df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep =',')

2. Flat File

but at times you might receive file that’s tab separated or a fixed width format or…
