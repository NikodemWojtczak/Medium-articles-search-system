What is Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment Analysis from Dictionary

I think this result from google dictionary gives a very succinct definition. I don’t have to re-emphasize how important sentiment analysis has become. So, here we will build a classifier on IMDB movie dataset using a Deep Learning technique called RNN.

I’m outlining a step-by-step process for how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can be implemented using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture:

Load in and visualize the data Data Processing — convert to lower case Data Processing — Remove punctuation Data Processing — Create list of reviews Tokenize — Create Vocab to Int mapping dictionary Tokenize — Encode the words Tokenize — Encode the labels Analyze Reviews Length Removing Outliers — Getting rid of extremely long or short reviews Padding / Truncating the remaining data Training, Validation, Test Dataset Split Dataloaders and Batching Define the LSTM Network Architecture Define the Model Class Training the Network Testing (on Test data and User- generated data)

1) Load in and visualize the data

We are using IMDB movies review dataset. If it is stored in your machine in a txt file then we just load it in
