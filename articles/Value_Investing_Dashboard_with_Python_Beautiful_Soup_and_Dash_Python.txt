Value Investing Dashboard with Python Beautiful Soup and Dash Python

Creating Python Value Investing Dashboard for data extractions

Problem Statement

“So I usually searched the stocks on the trading website like SGX or Yahoo Finance, and copy pasted the relevant dataset one by one into my Excelsheet” “There should be a quick access to the most relevant stocks information for me to make buy/sell decisions”

I still remembered on how my friend boasted on his hard earned excelsheet of different stocks ratios that he copy pasted from SGX (Singapore Stocks Exchange). Out of sheer determination, he duplicated the data one by one, juggling through hundreds of views and clicks to retrieve stocks information and dumped to excelsheet where he kept all of the formulas manually.

The whole process seems comical as there were lots of manual scrolls and clicks to extract seemingly large number to make buy/sell decisions. This problem inspired me to build my own tool to automate the extraction and process relevant financial ratios quickly.

Solution: Web Scraping and Dashboard Visualization

In this project, I would like to present to you a dashboard that you could use to quickly gain important financial feedback. Users only need to input the stocks ticker (such as GOOG or MSFT), and the application will handle all of the necessary critical ratios and calculations of Future Price. Once the information is retrieved from MarketWatch, the application will crunch the number into a predefined subset of values. The end result will showcase whether the users should buy/sell certain stocks depending on user defined marginal value and market price
