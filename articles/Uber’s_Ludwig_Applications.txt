Believe it or not, but a lack of coding skills is one of the most common self-excuses for not starting to work on data science and machine learning. This is why in the last few months and years a lot of companies created and open-sourced libraries and tools that allow no-coders to create their own machine learning projects.

These tools include Microsoft Azure ML Studio, Weka, Uber’s Ludwig and many others.

This article is a follow-up on my post “Introduction to Uber’s Ludwig”, where I explained what Uber’s Ludwig is and what it can be used for. In this article, I will try to explain how to use Uber’s Ludwig for different data including tabular data, image data, and text data.

The main focus of the article will be to help you get a good understanding of how to approach different problems so that after this article you will be able to solve your problems using Uber’s Ludwig.
