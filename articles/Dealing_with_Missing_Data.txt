I recently completed a project using machine learning to predict cervical cancer — the Jupyter notebook and all related source materials can be found in this GitHub repo. One of the challenges with this project was how to deal with missing values in many of the predictive variables. This article describes how I addressed this missing data.

Many machine learning models throw an error when they encounter missing data and there are many methods (and opinions!) for dealing with missing values. Among the simplest approaches is to fill the missing values with the mean of a particular variable, and I’ve seen many projects where that is the approach taken. It’s fast, easy, and can sometimes have good results. At the more difficult end of the spectrum are complex methods to impute missing values based on comparing the record having a missing value to similar records that are not missing a value for that factor. There are pros and cons to every approach and in my opinion, the best choice will always be case-specific.

As this was my first machine learning project involving significant missing values, I decided to take an easily interpretable path that involved looking at each factor one-by-one to get a better understanding of each factor’s distribution. To that end, I looked at count plots, boxplots, and measures of centrality (mean, median, mode). After evaluating this information I used one or more of the following methods to deal with the missing information:
