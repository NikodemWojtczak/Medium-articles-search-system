TLDR;

As a data scientist, the AWS Big Data Certification was worth it for me because I gained a more solid understanding of the base layers of the data science hierarchy of needs. The material I learned has helped me communicate better with my co-workers and made me a more flexible data professional.

Introduction

I’ve been a data scientist at Outcome Health for about 2 years now. We’ve done some interesting work, but throughout my tenure, I always had the nagging feeling that I didn’t understand enough about data infrastructure.

So, several months ago, I spent an hour a day for nearly 100 days straight studying for my AWS Big Data Certification. My AWS Big Data muscles got pretty ripped, and I was able to pass my certification exam on the first try!

But was it worth it?

For data scientists considering whether or not this certification is worthwhile, this article is for you!

The Benefits

Understanding the data science hierarchy of needs is critical to any data scientist’s job because it (1) helps you work better with your teammates and (2) enables you to pick up other job functions more quickly.

The AWS Big Data Certification can help bolster your knowledge of the lower levels of this hierarchy — typically where data engineers and DBAs step in.

Communication w/ Teammates

The primary difference I’ve seen between the before and after of working toward the certification is in my conversations with data engineers and DBAs on…
