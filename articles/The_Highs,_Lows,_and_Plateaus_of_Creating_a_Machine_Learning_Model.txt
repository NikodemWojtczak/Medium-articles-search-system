Day 1

We get our data, and we’re off! I began by taking a look at the target that I would be trying to predict — status of water pumps.

If I were to make an initial model that predicts that every pump is functional, I would be correct about 54% of the time.

Functional: 0.543

Non-functional: 0.384

Functional Needs Repair: 0.072

A 54% accuracy score is a start, but I know I can improve from here. After a quick glance at the data, I saw that a lot of columns have non-numeric data. It would take time to explore, clean, and encode this into numeric data before it is usable. I would like to make fast progress, so I elected to skip this step for now. I created a Linear Regression model using only the numeric columns, and got an accuracy score of 59%.

I am curious about the correlation between these features, so I took a deeper look using a heat map.

My target feature — “status_group” — does not appear to have a strong correlation with any of the numeric features. This leads me to my next task: getting all of the categorical data in usable format to add to my model.
