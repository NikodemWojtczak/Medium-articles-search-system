Apophenia or the “ tendency to mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things”. Humans it turns out are quite rubbish at telling things that are random apart from things that are not. In fact we sometimes see patterns where there are none and for others they can say something is random but have no scientific way of explaining it. You see this most often when people think that lottery numbers “1 2 3 4 5 6” are less likely to occur than say “12 3 15 82 90” or that if a sequence of numbers has come up it is less likely to come up again.

Don’t believe me? Then have a go at the question below.

I have two binary strings generated by two processes:

0001011000111110011111000000100101111110110111111111010111111011010000010001000100110000000001100001 1010101001011011001011100001101010101111001000101001010010100101000101011011010101011101010101010101

If I told you one was made by a random process and another by a biased process, can you tell which is which?

Would you believe me if I said there was an easy way to find out?

How about if I told you there was an easy way to tell them apart and in a factual way?

I have in fact given this question to around 60 highly educated consultants and the most common answer was a gut estimate that the top one (string 1) seems less structured than the bottom, so string 2 is the non-random one.

I mean they are not wrong and what they were picking up on was the “Frequency Stability Property” (also another link here), but it seems a bit hard to convince someone with only an experience led decision. For example, if they said it was string 1 and I said it wasn’t how would we tell who was lying or not? We need some harder evidence. This is where this easy method I eluded to earlier comes into play.

If you were to count the number of 1’s and 0’s in the strings you would find they both have the same number of each and so tells you little. However, for any random process any sequence within it (e.g. “11” or “101”) should have equal probability compared to another sequence of the same length. This is because the number before in a string should not…
