Data Science has been a hot field for a couple of years now, there’s no point in even discussing that. As a newcomer, you might be wondering what’s the best way to get into the field, and how quickly you could acquire some worthy knowledge.

In today’s article, I want to discuss two of the most popular ways of getting into any tech-related field, and those are:

By being self-taught

By getting a degree

And furthermore, I want to explore if those two options are somewhat different for a data science jobs, opposite to a let’s say front-end developer job.

Before starting, let me share a little background with you. I’m not a self-taught data scientist, I decided to go the college route. But before enrolling in my master’s, I learned to code on my own, a little bit with Java and Android, and a little bit with Python and data in general.

Because I have tried both, this article shouldn’t be biased. However, if you are making the decision right now, it should be based only on this article. I strongly encourage you to do further research as some stuff will differ from person to person, from country to country, and from college to college.

As I’m on college right now, the college route will be the first one to cover. Without further ado, let’s dive in.

The College Route

The college route is the one most people make, and there’s a good reason why.

If you’re thinking about enrolling into a Data Science master’s degree as I did, here are the 3 big questions you should know the answer to:

1. Does your country even offer a Data Science degree?

This one is kind of obvious, but Data Science isn’t just yet well recognized and represented in most universities. Sure, maybe you’ll dive a bit into machine learning on general Computer Science degree, but that’s not a Data Science specialization in any way, shape or form. Developing countries maybe still don’t offer a Data Science degree, so…
