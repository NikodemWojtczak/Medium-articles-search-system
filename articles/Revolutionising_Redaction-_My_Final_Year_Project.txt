Now with major changes in regulations, it has become even more important that personal data is secured and only seen by the right people. With this being such a hot topic right now, I was extremely keen to work on a final year project that could tap into this every increasing issue.

I am currently finishing my final year of studying software engineering at Queens University, Belfast and have been sponsored by Kainos to complete this project. In this blog I plan on taking you on a journey through my project, including the need for it and a high-level overview of the technologies used.

So, what is the problem?

Redaction is the actual process of removing sensitive information from documents and it needs to be completed across many different industries. It typically involves someone manually going through a document word by word looking for sensitive information to remove — which of course is a very time consuming and tedious task that is prone to human error

I’m sure we have all seen a few documents, that have ended up looking like this:

One of the major problems with redaction, is that when a lot of words have been removed, the whole context of the document can be lost.

My Solution

The overall aim of this project is to identify and remove sensitive information within a document, whilst still retaining its overall context. The project is divided into 3 main features:

1. Auto-Redactor — Aims to take a user’s document, automatically identify and replace the sensitive words and present them with a redacted copy of their document

2. User Selection redaction — Aims to take the user’s document, automatically identify the sensitive words, and send these words back to the user for them to select which ones they want removed.

3. Labeller — Aims at making the process of retraining the model to recognize more words easier and quicker.

How can I identify sensitive words?
