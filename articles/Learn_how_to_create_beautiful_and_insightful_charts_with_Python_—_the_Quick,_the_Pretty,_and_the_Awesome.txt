THE ULTIMATE PLOTTING WITH PYTHON GUIDE

Learn how to create beautiful and insightful charts with Python — the Quick, the Pretty, and the Awesome

2018: Regplot showing how Life Ladder (Happiness) is positively correlated with Log GDP per capita (Money)

In today’s article, we are going to look into three different ways of plotting data with Python. We will do this by utilizing data from the World Happiness Report 2019. I enriched the World Happiness Report data with information from Gapminder and Wikipedia to allow for the exploration of new relationships and visualizations.

The World Happiness Report tries to answer which factors influence happiness throughout the world.

Happiness in the report is defined as the responses to the “Cantril ladder question” asking respondents to value their lives today on a 0 to 10 scale, with the worst possible life as a 0 and the best possible life as a 10.

Throughout this article, I am going to use Life Ladder as a target variable. Whenever we talk about Life Ladder, think Happiness.

This article is intended as a code-along guide and a point of reference to revisit whenever you want to look up a specific type of plot. I will, for the sake of space, sometimes combine multiple charts into one image. But rest assured, you can find all the underlying code in this Repo or the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.
