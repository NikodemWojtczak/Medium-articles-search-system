Technical Dilemma

In other posts, I’ve explained what causation is and how to do causal inference using quasi-experimental designs (DID, ITS, RDD). Almost for all research methods, they have to meet two preconditions in order to generate meaningful insights:

1. the treated group looks like the control group (similarity for comparability); 2. a sufficiently large number of observations within each group (a large n).

These two preconditions lay the foundation for causal inference. However, is it possible to do causal inference if we only have one treated case and a few control cases? Even worse, what shall we do if there are no control cases with similar covariates as the treated case?

Under these situations, regression-based solutions (e.g., matching on key variables, or propensity score matching) perform poorly. Besides, other quasi-experimental designs such as the DID method require similar covariates between the treated and control groups and would generate a huge bias under these two scenarios.

In this post, I proudly present a statistical solution, the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), that is proposed by a group of political scientists like me. Honestly, the SCM has tremendous amount of causal potential but remains under-appreciated for now. It begins to capture some tractions in the industry as consumer-facing companies want to understand simulated consumer behaviors.

Basics

The SCM uses a weighted average of multiple cases from the “donor” pool to create an artificial control case.

Here is a simplified process:
