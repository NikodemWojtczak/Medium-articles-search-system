TL;DR: You can use this package to browse Reddit in Command Prompt and pretend you are working in the office.

What you can see in your command prompt when you browse subreddit ‘learnpython’ using braw

People always say learning in an interesting way is more effective than in a boring way. And I believe this is also true in programming. That’s why when I am now learning how to build a project on Python, I always look for some funny and interesting projects to give me a passion to work on. After a few days my first, small project is done and I call it braw (Browse Reddit At Work). At this moment, the package is only allowed for reading posts but not creating a new post or giving comments. This will be my second part of this small project.

Preparation

The Python Reddit API Wrapper (praw) is a Python package for wrapping Reddit. In my package, I will use it to gain access to Reddit and wrap content. For further information about praw, you can visit https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

In order to use this braw package, first you need to have a Reddit account. And you also need to get your personal client ID and client secret from Reddit Preference ->App ( https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)

name: Give a name

select script

description: blank

about url: blank

redirect url: http://www.example.com/unused/redirect/uri (it won’t use in the script, just for filling in)

Then in the next page, you will obtain your client Id and client secret
