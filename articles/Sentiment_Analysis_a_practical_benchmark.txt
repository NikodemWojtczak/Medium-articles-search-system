Sentiment Analysis: a practical benchmark

With hands-on practical Python code, we demonstrate limitations of simple recurrent neural networks and show how embeddings improve fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks for the classification of sentiment.

We show how to work with sequence data, by doing sentiment classification on a movie review dataset. Sentiments are basically feelings which include emotions, attitude and opinions written in natural language.

IMDB movie reviews dataset

We start by loading the IMDB dataset using Keras API. The reviews are already tokenized. We want to have a finite vocabulary to make sure that our word matrices are not arbitrarily small. We also want to have a finite length of reviews and not have to process really long sentences. Our training dataset has 25,000 customer reviews, together with their correct labels (either positive or negative).
