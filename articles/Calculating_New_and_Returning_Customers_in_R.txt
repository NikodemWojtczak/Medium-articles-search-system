I recently came across an issue in which I wanted to calculate new and returning customers. So, I naturally googled about it and was surprised to see that I could not find any solutions on it in R. This has generally been the issue with most blogs/tutorials on R, that they are not very business orientated.

Since I couldn't find a solution online, I started working on it myself. I was able to figure the solution out pretty quickly in Excel and Power BI using DAX and Power Pivot but I wanted to do it in R. Actually, I am a bit embarrassed to admit that the solution is pretty straightforward. I would expect you to have some basic understanding of the Tidyverse set of packages in R, mainly dplyr to get an understanding of this tutorial.

Before moving on, we first need to decide on how we define a customer as “New” or “Returning”

New Customer

Any customer who has not worked with us in the past will be classified as a “New Customer”

Returning Customer

Any customer who has worked with us in the past and comes back to work with us again in the current period is considered a “Returning Customer”

Loading Libraries

library(tidyverse)# For data manipulation

library(readxl) # Read in Excel File

library(lubridate)# Working with Dates

Loading and Viewing Data

We use the following code to read in the sales data and take a glimpse of it to check the data types.

sales_data <- read_xlsx(path="C:\\Users\\ACER\\Downloads\\sale_data.xlsx") glimpse(sales_data)

We get the following output. Sale Date is being shown as a date time variable while Customer ID is recognized as a numeric type.

We will now change the “Sale Date” and “Customer ID” columns to date and character type respectively using the mutate function from dplyr.

sales_data <- sales_data%>%

mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`),

`Customer ID`=as.character(`Customer ID`))

Now that our data is ready, the first thing we will do is to calculate the date of first engagement at every row against each customer. This will determine whether they were a new customer or a returning customer at that point in time.
