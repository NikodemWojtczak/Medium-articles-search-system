Visualisation of Information from Raw Twitter Data — Part 2

Want to find out user activity, see if certain users are Bots, make a Time Series of the Tweet Publications and much more? Read on then! James Thorn · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 9 min read · Jun 27, 2019 -- 2 Share

The previous post covered how to download data from Twitter regarding a certain topic, getting this data ready in a Jupyter Notebook, discovering insights from this data, and explored some very cool visualisation techniques. If you have not read it, you can find it here:

This second post will describe other awesome visualisations, while also exploring some more information that can be obtained from the downloaded tweets.

We will start by discovering information about the users who are posting the tweets:

#Lets take a look at the users who are posting these tweets: print("There are {} different users".format(tweets['Username'].nunique()))

In my case, the tweets were posted by 59508 different users.

Using our neatly prepared dataframe we can see who are the users that posted the most tweets, and something even cooler: see the chance of the highly active users being Bots!
