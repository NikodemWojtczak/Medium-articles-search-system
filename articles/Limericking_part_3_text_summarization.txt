The only problem is that Limericking is but one account. The rest of the mainstream media has so far ignored my demands to report all news in rhyming verse, leaving most of our news consumption dangerously un-versified. I hope to help bridge the gap by bringing the great powers of automation to bear on the problem with the creation of an automatic-limericking-program. Can a function take in a news text, properly interpret it for meaning and re-craft it into a limerick? I believe the answer is yes, though it may take me a few more blog posts to work through all the kinks. I have auto-generated some surprisingly succesful haikus, however.

The first big task is finding a way for the computer to ‘read’ a given news text and return some sort of summary or set of keywords. Later we’ll have to think about how to get the computer generate its own text that scans properly and rhymes (and has a proper comedic turn), but for now, simply extracting the topic out of the text has proven hard enough. My last entry in this series discussed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to try to group articles together into ‘topics’ and identify meaningful words associated with those topics. Results were not great.

Perhaps I’ve been overthinking this part of the challenge, though. For as difficult a problem as topic modeling is, one of the things that my initial haiku writing function from part 1 did surprisingly well was identifying what the news article was about. I simply reasoned that the article would likely be about a proper noun, like a person or company, and that the subject would likely occur multiple times in the text of the article. Simply finding the proper nouns and counting which ones occur most often goes a long way towards identifying what the article is about. One…
