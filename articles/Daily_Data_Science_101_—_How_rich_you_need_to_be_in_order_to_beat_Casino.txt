Daily Data Science 101 — How rich you need to be in order to beat Casino? Yuzhi Nino Yao · Follow 6 min read · Nov 8, 2019 -- Listen Share

Just graduate from high school, your parents may give you the first tuition. However, it seems like the university does not want to charge you right after you enter the school. What would you do?

Casino

Actually, Don’t do that and here are the reasons why you should, from a data scientist.

“Martingale” strategy

You may hear about a “must-win” strategy named “Martingale” strategy.

This is a classic roulette strategy called the “Martingale” strategy. Consider how the strategy plays out for a single sequence of spins {Black, Black, Red}.

Now consider a sequence {Black, Black, Black, Red}.

The Martingale strategy appears to always end in positive earnings regardless of how unlucky a string of spins may be.

wow, it seems like as long as you are not the most unlucky guy in the casino, you gonna win your pocket money for sure!

Hold on, is it true?

How much money do you have in the beginning?

The average cost of tuition and fees for the 2018–2019 school year was $35,676 at private colleges.

$9,716 for state residents at public colleges and

$21,629 for out-of-state students at state schools, according to data reported to U.S. News in an annual survey.

Imagine that you are a Nashville kid and you are lucky enough as your partners already prepared your tuition for you. If you go to Vanderbilt, which is a private school. This year, you will have $36,000 in your pocket. If you go to Tennessee State University, you will have $10,000. If you go to UC, Berkeley, you will have$22,000. Aight, with our budget, Let’s go to North Carolina and earn our pocket money!

Simple math

In martingale strategy, it seems like we have two main villains which are the

green zero pocket

and

running out of money too quickly — — we may not able to double up again and recover the money we’ve lost!

Green Hole!

For the first villain, we cannot do anything about it. That’s how every casino runs its business. The safest outside bets have almost 50% chance of winning — 48.6%, to be precise.

Out of money before we win!

However, we can definitely use our computer simulation to calculate and explore the second villains!

Give it a try.

Well, no one wants to take a big risk in the beginning. Let’s give it a try with a small amount of money!

Our budget begins at 200 dollars, We will quit the game after we win 300 in total, we do not want to spend the whole night at Casino either thus we will only play 1000 games at most, the betting limit of the casino table maybe, let’s say, 100 dollars.

What’s gonna happen on the first night in North Carolina?

## [1] "Estimated probability" "0.5081" ## [1] "Estimated earnings" "-47.5832"

After 10000 times simulation, we can tell that 4970 of the nights you gonna lost it all and 5030 of the nights you gonna earn your pocket money.

let’s see what exactly happened in a “bad luck” night.

Yes! It only takes about 8 games and you will lose all your money!

The average walking out money minus your gambling budget is your “Estimated earnings”, which is -49 dollars. It means, statistically speaking, you will lose 49 dollars once you enter the casino and play the game.

What if I play it safer?

You may think about you can decrease your winning expectation in order to take less risk but still make the money.

We can definitely try it. Let’s change our goal from 300 to 250.

## [1] "Estimated probability" "0.6946" ## [1] "Estimated earnings" "-26.35"

Even we play in a safer way, our “Estimated earnings” still below 0.

What if I have a bigger budget?

As a Vandy student, 200 dollars means nothing to your expansive tuition. Let’s make it big!

Now we have 36000 dollars to start our game and our winning budget is 55000.

Different from last night, we are the VIP of the casino right now. The limitation of the table is 15000.

What will happen?

## [1] "Estimated probability" "0.9409" ## [1] "Estimated earnings" "-541.3339"

Wow, you have a 94% chance to win! However, the Estimated earnings is -541.8. Even you have a much bigger budget in the beginning, you still have a 6% chance to lose it all.

The maximum you can win is only about 500 dollars.

Risking 36000 dollars for only 500 dollars! Does not worth it at all.

The odds of losing streak.

What’s the losing streak probability looks like?

It looks unlikely, but it will occur more often than you think. With each win we will win $1, so once we have won 27 times we’ll have enough cash in order to afford a losing streak of 6 and bet on the 7th.

How many games do I need to play?

Time is also very valuable to us. If we spend a whole night in the casino and only earn 40 dollars, it is not a good deal. Let’s see how many games do we need to play before we stop.

## [1] 201.7794

Great! We need to spend about 190 games in the casino per night, which means we need to spend at least 3hrs in the casino!

Other concerns

Remember, Simulation is not precise. It can only tell us a set of the system’s responses to different operating conditions. In the real world, there are many other variables gonna affect our simulation.

For example, Does the casino play the game fairly? What if they cheat? What if you lost your mind and bet everything you have in hand?

Simulation only generates a way of evaluating solutions but does not generate solutions themselves.

Considering the estimated earnings, we may want to keep our tuition and find other ways to make money.
