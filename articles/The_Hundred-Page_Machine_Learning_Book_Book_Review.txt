Should you buy the book?

Yes. But you don’t have to. You can read it first. But you should buy a copy, hold it, read it, sit it on your coffee table. Then when your friends ask, ‘What is machine learning?’, you’ll be able to tell them.

Who is the book for?

Maybe you’re studying data science. Or you’ve heard of machine learning being everywhere and you want to understand what it can do. Or you’re familiar with applying the tools of machine learning but you want to make sure you’re not missing any.

I’ve been studying and practising machine learning for the past two-years. I built my own AI Masters Degree, it led to being a machine learning engineer. This book is part of my curriculum now but if it was out when I started, it would’ve been on there from the beginning.

What previous knowledge do I need for the Hundred-Page Machine Learning book?

Having a little knowledge about math, probability and statistics would be helpful but The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book has been written a way that you’ll get most of these as you go.

So the answer to this question remains open. I read it from the perspective of a machine learning engineer, I knew some things but learned many more.
