Susan Holcomb has seen it all.

In 2014, she joined the world’s first smartwatch company, Pebble, as their first data-focused employee. She would go on to lead their entire data science effort — and faced the daunting challenge of figuring out how to work with a kind of data that virtually no one had encountered until then.

Susan is also a gifted networker: you don’t go from physics grad student dropout to Head of Data at one of Silicon Valley’s hottest startups without knowing how to reach out to the right people.

We sat down with Susan to talk about the skills (and personality) that make for a great data science career, and her tried-and-true tips for anyone looking to get the attention of hiring managers in data science. Check that out here, and don’t forget to give her a follow on Twitter at @h0lc0mb!
