The code along with the text is available in my public Github repository. I have pulled the text from Project Gutenberg and pre-processed before uploading to the repository. You can also find an outstanding tutorial on RNN text generation here.

Setup

Let’s download what we need for the project and confirm everything is as expected and the GPUs are available (you certainly want a GPU on this one, will save you a lot of time):

from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals !pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0

import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np

import os

import datetime from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib

print(device_lib.list_local_devices()) print(“TensorFlow version: “, tf.__version__)

If everything is in good order, you’ll see that you’re using TensforFlow 2.0.0-alpha0 and, if running the code on Google’s Colab, a beautiful piece of GPU machinery called Tesla T4. I like checking the device list, especially on Colab, because sometimes I forget to change the runtime type, so this serves as a reminder. In this case, Colab will put you on the GPU runtime due to the tensorflow-gpu download, but otherwise the default is CPU.

To run the code in Google Colab, either upload the notebook directly on the Colab site through the File > Upload Notebook menu or simply click the respective icon in the upper left of the notebook.

To download the text to Colab, use this snippet:

from google.colab import files uploaded = files.upload() for fn in uploaded.keys():

print(‘User uploaded file “{name}” with length {length} bytes’.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))

NB: “Code snippets” in Colab are a great resource for mini solutions.

You’ll find the uploaded text file under the Files tab — not that you’d even need to look it up, considering you’ll be informed when the file is uploaded in the notebook itself. As you probably know, your work and files in Colab are ephemeral and will be gone next time you log in, so it is important to save your work somewhere else before you log off.

import os

path = os.getcwd() text = open(path + ‘/Iliad_v3.txt’, ‘rb’).read().decode(encoding=’utf-8')

print(“Text is {} characters long”.format(len(text)))

The text should be 886,809 characters long, so not a huge sample. Out of curiosity, we can also check the number of words, so that I know if the text was worth skipping when I was in high school:

words = [w for w in text.split(‘ ‘) if w.strip() != ‘’ or w == ‘

’]

print(“Text is {} words long”.format(len(words)))

There should be 153,260 words, so really not as long as it seemed back then.

Just to make sure the machine is reading what is expected, quickly check the first 100 characters:
