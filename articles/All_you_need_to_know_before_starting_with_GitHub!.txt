GitHub is everywhere. Developers, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Statisticians, Data Analysts, all are confronted to GitHub at some point.

In this article, I give you a jump start into GitHub for those who want to get into the basics quickly.

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform that is used by developers to work together on the same program at the same time. The underlying program is called Git and it keeps track of different versions and by giving support for merging conflicting modifications by different people.

Git is the program that allows developers to track changes in their code.

As an example, imagine that three friends have a great software idea. They are all coders and they want to be able to contribute at the same time. There is no ‘Google docs’ for code, so they need something else: this is when they need Git to allow working on the same code at the same time.

Git is the program that actually does the work

So why need GitHub?

GitHub is an online hosting platform of code that you share through Git. Git is a command-line tool, GitHub adds an excellent web platform to share between developers and it also gives you an external backup of your code.

GitHub adds online functionalities to Git and allows developers to share projects easily.

For example, for contributing to open-source software, developers often use GitHub. By using GitHub, you can easily find the code of open source projects online and propose a contribution. Git alone here is not enough, because you need to be able to find those projects online. GitHub also makes the way of proposing contributions go much smoother.

GitHub is an online platform based on Git.
