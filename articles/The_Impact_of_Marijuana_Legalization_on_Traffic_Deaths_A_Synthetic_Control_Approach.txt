With the rise of marijuana legalization, there has also been rising questions regarding the potential impact on traffic deaths and collisions. Here, we will perform an analysis using Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to determine the impact marijuana legalization had on driving fatalities.

Selected Sample

So far, 11 states have voted to legalize recreational marijuana. Some of the states are still awaiting full legislation to be implemented or legalized too recently to collect adequate data on. With this in mind, we have several states that can be analyzed:

Alaska Colorado Oregon Washington

For this analysis, we will be using the fatality rate used by the NHTSA: fatalities per 100 million miles driven. To start, we can see the rate of fatalities per 100 million miles traveled for all 4 states since legalization of marijuana was enacted.

Fatality rates increased in three out of four states — the exception being Alaska. However, it is more difficult to identify if there is a causal relationship between these variables. To determine that will take a more rigorous analysis. For simplicity, I will only analyze Colorado and Washington (the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana). Both of these states legalized marijuana in early 2014 and provide us with the longest period to analyze.

Building A Synthetic Control

The method of establishing causality here is the Synthetic Control Method. Before we proceed any further, we should clear up some terminology that will be used. An “intervention” or “treatment” is the event to which we are studying the impact of (in this case, recreational marijuana legalization). A “treated group” refers to the group which underwent the intervention. For this analysis, it is the states of Colorado and Washington. Predictor variables are variables that are able to impact the dependent variable.
