A general understanding of what self-driving cars are really about.

Every year, there are around 1.25 million deaths caused by road accidents. Thatâ€™s equivalent to 3,287 deaths on a daily basis! As a teenager just learning how to drive, this is a scary fact that lingers at the back of my mind. On top of that, thereâ€™s also a ridiculous amount of traffic that we have to suffer through, which just creates unnecessary frustration for most people.

This got me thinking â€¦ is there another way we can replicate the driving of humans, but 20x better?

This is where I discovered self-driving cars.

How do self-driving cars work?

With self-driving cars (SDC), the goal is to be able to operate a car like a human driver. The only catch is that thereâ€™s no driver behind the seat.

Sounds scary, right?

Youâ€™re probably wondering, how does a computer (or a car, in this case) come close to human intelligence when doing something so complex? To answer that, we need to understand the five components that make up an SDC:

If you donâ€™t understand those terms, donâ€™t worry! For now, a good way to approach this would be to think of an SDC like a human being.

Computer vision

Like a human driver, we need to be able to see the environment around us, whether thatâ€™s looking ahead for traffic or reading road signs, vision is ðŸ”‘ .

Similarly, computer vision is how a car sees its environment.

In computer vision for SDC, the goal is to be able to identify objects near the car. We do that by using an image classification network called (Convolutional Neural Networks).
