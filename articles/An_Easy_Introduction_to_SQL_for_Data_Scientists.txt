SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardised programming language designed for data storage and management. It allows one to create, parse, and manipulate data fast and easy.

With the AI-hype of recent years, technology companies serving all kinds of industries have been forced to become more data driven. When a company that serves thousands of customers is data driven, they’ll need a way to store and frequently access data on the order of millions or even billions of data points.

That’s where SQL comes in.

SQL is popular because it’s both fast and easy to understand. It’s designed to be read and written in a similar way to the English language. When an SQL query is used to retrieve data, that data is not copied anywhere, but instead accessed directly where it’s stored making the process much faster than other approaches.

This tutorial will teach you the basics of SQL including:

Creating database tables

Populating the database tables with real data

Retrieving your data for usage in a Data Science or Machine Learning task

Let’s jump right into it!

Installing MySQL

The first thing we’ll do is actually install our SQL server! That’ll give us a workbench to start playing around with databases and SQL queries.

To install a MySQL server, you can run the following command from your terminal:

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Now we’ll start our MySQL server. This is similar to how we start Python in the terminal by just typing out “python”. The only difference here is that it’s convenient to give our server root privileges so we’ll have flexible access to everything.

sudo mysql -u root -p

Great! Now our mysql server is running and we can start issuing MySQL commands.

A couple of things to keep in mind before we move forward:
