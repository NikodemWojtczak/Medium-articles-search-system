Recurrent Neural Network

The Recurrent neural networks are a class of artificial neural networks where the connection between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. Unlike the feed-forward neural networks, the recurrent neural networks use their internal state memory for processing sequences. This dynamic behavior of the Recurrent neural networks allows them to be very useful and applicable to audio analysis, handwritten recognition, and several such applications.

Simple RNN implementation in Keras.

Mathematically the simple RNN can be formulated as follows:

Where x(t) and y(t) are the input and output vectors, Wᵢₕ, Wₕₕ, and Wₕₒ are the weight matrices and fₕ and fₒ are the hidden and output unit activation functions.

The implementation of RNN with 2 Simple RNN layers each with 32 RNN cells followed by time distribute dense layers for 10 class classification can be illustrated as follows:
