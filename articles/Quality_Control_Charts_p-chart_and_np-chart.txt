Quality Control Charts

Quality control charts represent a great tool for engineers to monitor if a process is under statistical control. They help visualize variation, find and correct problems when they occur, predict expected ranges of outcomes and analyze patterns of process variation from special or common causes. Quality control charts are often used in Lean Six Sigma projects and DMAIC projects under the control phase and are considered as one of the seven basic quality tools for process improvement.

However, how can we determine the right quality control chart to use for monitoring a process? The following decision tree can be used to identify which is the correct quality control chart to use based on the given data:

Quality Control Charts Decision Tree

For the following examples, we will be focusing on quality control charts for discrete data that consider one defect per unit (i.e. defective or not defective unit), for when the sample size is constant and for when it is not.

p-chart

The p-chart is a quality control chart used to monitor the proportion of nonconforming units in different samples of size n; it is based on the binomial distribution where each unit has only two possibilities (i.e. defective or not defective). The y-axis shows the proportion of nonconforming units while the x-axis shows the sample group. Letâ€™s take a look at the R code using the qcc package to generate a p-chart.
