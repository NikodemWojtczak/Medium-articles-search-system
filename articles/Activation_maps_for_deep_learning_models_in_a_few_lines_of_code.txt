Deep learning has a bad rep: ‘black-box’

Deep Learning (DL) models are revolutionizing the business and technology world with jaw-dropping performances in one application area after another — image classification, object detection, object tracking, pose recognition, video analytics, synthetic picture generation — just to name a few.

However, they are like anything but classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms/techniques. DL models use millions of parameters and create extremely complex and highly nonlinear internal representations of the images or datasets that are fed to these models.

They are, therefore, often called the perfect black-box ML techniques. We can get highly accurate predictions from them after we train them with large datasets, but we have little hope of understanding the internal features and representations of the data that a model uses to classify a particular image into a category.

Black-box problem of deep learning — predictive power without an intuitive and easy-to-follow explanation.

This does not bode well because we, humans, are visual creatures. Millions of years of evolution have gifted us an amazingly complex pair of eyes and an even more complex visual cortex, and we use those organs for making sense of the world.

The scientific process starts with observation, and that is almost always synonymous with vision. In business, only what we can observe and measure, we can control and manage…
