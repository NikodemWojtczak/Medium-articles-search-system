Introduction

What if we used machine learning to give an estimate for when the book was written?

Picture yourself in your grandparents’ old attic, perusing the old, dusty bookshelf when an unfamiliar tome grabs your eye. It appears to be a novel. You don’t know when it was written, an answer that even seems to elude Google itself. You snap a picture of one of the pages and, using a text extractor, you obtain a digital representation of the text. What if we used machine learning to give an estimate for when the book was written?

In this post, we’re going to discuss and implement some methods to try to date texts. Beyond the stated example, this type of model has applications in a range of fields, from detecting fake news, to fighting historical revisionism, to improving historically accurate fiction, to determining the authenticity of posthumous literary works.

One of the most interpretable models for this task are decision trees, which can offer fascinating inferences about which types of words can be used to differentiate text dates.
