2. Data Engineering vs. Data Science

‘Data engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers, giving meaning to an otherwise static entity.’ Urthecast’s David Bianco notes.

These two positions are not interchangeable. However, there is a significant overlap between Data Engineers and Data Scientists when it comes to skills and responsibilities. The main difference lies in their FOCUS on a different aspect of data utilization.

In short, Data Engineers are focused on building infrastructure and architecture for data generation, while Data Scientists are focused on advanced mathematics and statistical analysis on that generated data.

The difference in skillsets translates into differences in languages, tools, and software that both use. Below a great overview by DataCamp including both commercial and open-source alternatives and overlapping area.

If you need another explanation between Data Engineer and Data Scientist, have a look at a widely shared AI Hierarchy of Needs by Monica Rogati.

Data Engineering covers the first 2–3 stages, while Data Science — stages 4 and 5.

Data Engineers are just as important as Data Scientists but seem to be less visible because they tend to move away from the final analysis product. According to Dataquest, it is just like with a race car builder and race car driver.
