Highest Rated ML Projects on Github

Machine learning, as a field, is growing at a breakneck speed. Github is that whiteboard which the whole world is watching. Top quality code is being regularly posted on that infinite board of wisdom.

It is obviously impossible to track all things that go on in the world of machine learning but Github has a star-rating for each project. Basically, if you star a repository, you show your appreciation for the project as well as keep track of repositories that you find interesting.

This star rating then can be one of the good metrics to know the most followed projects. Let’s take a look at 5 highly rated ones.

The world’s simplest tool for facial recognition. It provides an application programming interface (API) for Python and the command line. It is useful for recognising and manipulating faces in images. It is built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition algorithm. The deep-learning model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.

It also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line itself!

This library can also handle real-time face recognition
