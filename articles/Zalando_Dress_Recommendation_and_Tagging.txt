In Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision techniques are massively applied. A nice field of application (one of my favorite) is the fashion industry. The availability of resources in terms of raw images allows for developing interesting use cases. Zalando knows this (I suggest to take a look at their GitHub repository) and frequently develops amazing AI solutions, or publishes juicy ML research studies.

In the AI community, Zalando research team is also known for the release of Fashion-MNIST, a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article images, which aims to replace the traditional MNIST dataset in the study of machine learning. Recently they released another interesting dataset: the Feidegger. A dataset composed of dress images and related textual descriptions. Like the previous one, this data was donated by Zalando to the research community to experiment with various text-image tasks such as captioning and image retrieval.

In this post I make use of this data to build:

a Dress Recommendation System based on image similarity;

based on image similarity; a Dress Tagging System based only on the textual description.

THE DATASET

The dataset itself consists of 8732 high-resolution images, each depicting a dress from the available on the Zalando shop against a white-background. For each of the images were provided five textual annotations in German, each of which has been generated by a separate user. The example below shows 2 of the 5 descriptions for a dress (English translations only given for illustration, but not part of the dataset).

At the beginning the dataset stores for each singular description the related image (in URL format): we have for a singular dress plus entries. We start to merge the description of the same dress to easily operate with images and reduce duplicates.
