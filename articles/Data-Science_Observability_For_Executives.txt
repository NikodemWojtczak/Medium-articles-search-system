Data-Science Observability For Executives

Observability for data-science (DS) is a new and emerging field, which is sometimes mentioned in tandem with MLOps or AIOps. New offerings are being developed by young startups to address the lack of monitoring and alerts for everything data-science. However, they are mostly addressing data-scientists or -engineers, which are, of course, the first personas that feel the pain of managing multiple models. However, I will try to argue that the impact of data-science observability should be aimed toward decision-makers such as high & mid-level managers, the people who are responsible for spending, funding, managing and most importantly are accountable for the impact of the data-science-operation on the company’s clients, business, product, sales, and lets not forget the company’s bottom line.

In my previous post, I have written about the many use cases and the monumental importance of monitoring & alerts, specifically from a data-science-researcher point-of-view. However, in this post we will cover several personas that are influenced by DS processes, most importantly high-level executives such as Investors & CEOs that invest a lot of money into DS infrastructures, teams, development and DevOps, but are not fully aware of the various impact points that DS has on their business. I will argue that high-level management needs to care about DS-related metrics similarly to metrics that are observed for business, financial, sales, marketing, and product management, metrics such as life-time-value (LTV), customer-acquisition-cost (CAC), Customer Retention Cost (CRC), Daily Average Users (DAU), Monthly Average Users (MAU), Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), etc.

Let’s start with a few personas that have a shared or full responsibility for anything related to DS and discuss the scope of it.
