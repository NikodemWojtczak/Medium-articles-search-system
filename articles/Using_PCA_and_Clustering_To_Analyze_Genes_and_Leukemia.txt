In the world of Machine Learning, unsupervised learning is the process of drawing inference without labeled outcomes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering are two common unsupervised learning techniques.

PCA is the process of reducing high dimensions into a few layers of key features. After dimension reduction, we only have to deal with a small number of features and leave others out.

Clustering is the task of assigning data inputs with similar features to a specific group. After clustering, data points within the same group should be similar but dramatically different from the one in other groups.

In this post, Iâ€™ll apply PCA and Hierarchical Clustering to a life science dataset to analyze how specific genes affect the leukemia type.

The dataset was originally collected by Yeoh et al. (2002) with 3141 genes, a class of 7 leukemia subtypes from 327 patients (here).
