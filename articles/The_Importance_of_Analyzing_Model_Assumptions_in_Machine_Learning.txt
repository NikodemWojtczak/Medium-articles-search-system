The Importance of Analyzing Model Assumptions in Machine Learning

By Reilly Meinert, Adeet Patel, & Simon Li

Checking model assumptions is essential prior to building a model that will be used for prediction. If assumptions are not met, the model may inaccurately reflect the data and will likely result in inaccurate predictions. Each model has different assumptions that must be met, so checking assumptions is important both in choosing a model and in verifying that it is the appropriate model to use.

Diagnostics

Diagnostics are used to evaluate the model assumptions and figure out whether or not there are observations with a large, undue influence on the analysis. They can be used to optimize the model by making sure the model you use is actually appropriate for the data you are analyzing. There are many ways to assess the validity of a model using diagnostics. Diagnostics is an overarching name that covers the other topics under model assumptions. It may include exploring the model’s basic statistical assumptions, examining the structure of a model by considering more, fewer, or different explanatory variables, or looking for data that is poorly represented by a model such as outliers or that have a large imbalanced effect on the regression model’s prediction.

Diagnostics can take many forms. There are numerical diagnostics you can examine. The statsmodels package provides a summary of many diagnostics through the summary function:

With this summary, we can see important values such as R2, the F-statistic, and many others. You can also analyze a model using a graphical diagnostic such as plotting the residuals against the fitted/predicted values.

Above is the fitted versus residual plot for our weight-height dataset, using height as the predictor. For the most part, this plot is random. However, as fitted values increase, so does the range of residuals. This means that as BMI increases, there is higher variance between our model and the actual data. It…
