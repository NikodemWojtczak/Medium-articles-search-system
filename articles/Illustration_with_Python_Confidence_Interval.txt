This article uses knowledge in the central limit theorem, and also the concept of the weak law of large numbers and Chebyshevâ€™s inequality, you can review these topics by visiting the links. If you would like to follow along, you can get the code from this link: Jupyter Notebook.

In my opinion, this topic is the most confusing theorem compare with others, even the article in Wikipedia mentions the misunderstanding about it, so I will try my best to explain it.

Before diving in, keep in mind that the mean of the population (the thing we what to estimate) is a constant, there is no randomness about the number.

The confidence interval is an estimator we use to estimate the value of population parameters. The interval will create a range that might contain the values. When we create the interval, we use a sample mean. Recall the central limit theorem, if we sample many times, the sample mean will be normally distributed.

I create the sample mean distribution to demonstrate this estimator.
