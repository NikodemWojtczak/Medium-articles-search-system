I’ve been using R since 2004, long before the Tidyverse was introduced. I knew I’d benefit from fully getting up to speed on the newest packages and functionality, and I finally decided to take the plunge and fully update my skills. I wanted a course that was going to cover every nook and cranny in R. My personal experience learning R had been pasting together tutorials and reading documentation as I needed something. I wanted to be introduced to functions I may not need now, but may have a use case for in the future. I wanted everything.

I’ve known for a while that the Tidyverse was a massive improvement over using base R functionality for manipulating data. However, I also knew my old school skills got the job done. I have now seen the light. There is a better way. It wasn’t super painful to make the move (especially since I’m familiar with programming) and the Business Science’s “Business Analysis with R” course will take you from 0 to pretty dangerous in 4 weeks.

For the person with no R experience who doesn’t want to bang their head on the wall for years trying to get to a “serious R user” level. I highly recommend this Business Science’s “Business Analysis with R” course. Don’t let the name fool you, the course spends 5 hours of using the parsnip package for machine learning techniques. And more importantly, how to communicate those results to stakeholders.

The course was thorough, clear, and concise.

Course Coverage

General:

The course takes you from the very beginning:

Installing R

This course “holds your hand” on your journey to becoming self-sufficient in R. I couldn’t possibly list everything in this article that is…
