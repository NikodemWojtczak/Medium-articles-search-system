You have heard about “pythonic” code and yours falls short. You’re an intermediate Python programmer. You want to move to advanced.

This intermediate zone is a common place for data scientists to sit. So many of us are self-taught programmers using our programming languages as a means to a data analysis end. As a result, we are less likely to take a deep dive into our programming language and we’re less exposed to the best practices of software engineering.

The book consists of 21 chapters divided into five broad sections:
