Different players have different strengths and weaknesses — is there a way to visualize them?

Introduction

Back in the early 2000’s, the New York Giants had an exciting running back duo. Tiki Barber (“Lightning”) went for about 1000 yards rushing and 550 yards receiving a year. That’s impressive on its own, but even more impressive because Ron Dayne (“Thunder”), an early first rounder, was on the same team. Dayne’s yardage totals were less impressive (roughly 40 yards/game), but the yards that he gained were all tough to get, and he was rewarded with plenty of touchdowns. He was the goal line, short yardage back. It’s not hard to figure out how they got their nicknames.

Across the league, at all positions, there are different player styles and player roles at the same position. Using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms, we can easily sort out these players into separate categories and do so without biases that might come from film study. PCA and clustering algorithms sound fancy, but they’re pretty intuitive. I’m far from the first to do this sort of analysis — here’s a great version of the same process for NBA players from Nadir Nibras.

Step 1: Select Features

The first step to classifying players is to figure out what separates certain players from others. There are very obvious features, like yards per game or touchdowns in a season. You don’t need unsupervised learning algorithms to tell Cam Newton from Blaine Gabbert, and if that’s all that I was comparing, the article would be over by now. Height and weight are also obvious features, especially if you watched Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne, and so I scraped them from pro-football-reference.com to include them. I ended up with quite a few features for each player, and that’s not a bad thing as long as they are all relevant. The features I did pick are subjective, and open for debate!
