Installing the necessary packages

To start off, we would need to install PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and ONNX-TF (the package to convert ONNX models to TensorFlow). If using virtualenv in Linux, you could run the command below (replace tensorflow with tensorflow-gpu if you have NVidia CUDA installed). Do note that as of Dec 2019, ONNX does not work with TensorFlow 2.0 yet, so please take note of the version of the TensorFlow that you install.

source <your virtual environment>/bin/activate

pip install tensorflow==1.15.0

pip install torch torchvision # if using CUDA 10.1

pip install torch==1.3.1+cu92 torchvision==0.4.2+cu92 -f

pip install torch==1.3.1+cpu torchvision==0.4.2+cpu -f # For PyTorch, choose one of the following (refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for further details)pip install torch torchvision # if using CUDA 10.1pip install torch==1.3.1+cu92 torchvision==0.4.2+cu92 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html # if using CUDA 9.2pip install torch==1.3.1+cpu torchvision==0.4.2+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html # if using CPU only pip install onnx

git clone

cd onnx-tensorflow

pip install -e . . # For onnx-tensorflow, you may want to refer to the installation guide here: https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow git clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow.git cd onnx-tensorflowpip install -e . .

If using Conda, you may want to run the following commands instead:

conda activte <your virtual environment>

conda install -c pytorch pytorch pip install tensorflow==1.15.0 pip install onnx

git clone

cd onnx-tensorflow

pip install -e . . # For onnx-tensorflow, you may want to refer to the installation guide here: https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow git clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow.git cd onnx-tensorflowpip install -e . .

I find that installing TensorFlow, ONNX, and ONNX-TF using pip will ensure that the packages are compatible with one another. It is OK, however, to use other ways of installing the packages, as long as they work properly in your machine.

To test that the packages have been installed correctly, you can run the following commands:

python

import tensorflow as tf

import torch

import onnx

from onnx_tf.backend import prepare

If you do not see any error messages, it means that the packages are installed correctly, and we are good to go.

In this example, I used Jupyter Notebook, but the conversion can also be done in a .py file. To install Jupyter Notebook, you can run one of the following commands:
