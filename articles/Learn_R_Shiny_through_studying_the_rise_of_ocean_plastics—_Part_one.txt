In a very recent article in the journal Nature, a team of marine scientists analyzed data that had been captured in devices called Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) since the 1930s. CPRs are towed by vessels during their routine journeys and are designed to capture plankton for research purposes.

But beginning in 1957, CPRs started to accidentally capture another piece of data — one which we didn’t know we would find useful until recently — because in that year, a CPR was found to be contaminated with a man-made plastic object for the first time.

For their journal article, the team of scientists painstakingly put together a dataset of all such incidents of man-made plastics being found in CPRs in the North Atlantic, Arctic and Northern European seas from the first recorded incident in 1957 through to 2016. They also gave the public access to that dataset — a total of 208 incidents of various types of plastic ranging from fishing nets to plastic bags.

As I looked at the dataset here, I realized that it is a great dataset to help teach someone how to create a data exploration app using R Shiny, and this is what I will do in this series of articles. The dataset is limited in size so easy to work with, but contains a wide range of information including dates, text, and geographic co-ordinate data.

To follow this series, you need some basic experience in data manipulation in R, including using RStudio as a coding environment. Some previous experience using RMarkdown, Shiny, and simple plotting in ggplot2 is helpful but not essential. You will need to install the following packages before you start: shiny , RMarkdown , ggplot2 , tidyverse and leaflet .

In this series you will learn how to:
