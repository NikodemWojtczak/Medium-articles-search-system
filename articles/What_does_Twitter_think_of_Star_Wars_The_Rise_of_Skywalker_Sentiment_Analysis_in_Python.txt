Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was recently released in theaters. Disney reported $40 million in previews for the new release which makes it the fifth highest preview of all time. It is tracking between $170 and $200 million in ticket sales opening weekend. By those numbers, it is pretty clear that this new release is a box office success. The question I seek to answer in this post is: What is the general sentiment for the film amongst twitter users?

In this post we will use the twitter python API, tweepy, to pull Twitter tweets related to the new Star Wars film. We will then use TextBlob, a python library used for processing text data, to generate sentiment scores for tweets related to the film. Finally, we will visualize our results using python visualization packages seaborn and Matplotlib.

To get started you need to apply for a Twitter developer account:

After your developer account has been approved, you need to create a Twitter application:

The steps for applying for a Twitter developer account and creating a Twitter application are outlined here.

We will be using the free python library tweepy in order to access the Twitter API. Documentation for tweepy can be found here.

INSTALLATION

First, make sure you have tweepy installed. Open up a command line and type:

pip install tweepy

2. IMPORT LIBRARIES

Next, open up your favorite editor and import the tweepy and pandas libraries:

import tweepy

import pandas as pd

3. AUTHENTICATION

Next, we need our consumer key and access token:
