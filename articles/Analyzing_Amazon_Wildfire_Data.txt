As a result of the warming climate, wildfires in the Amazon rain forest have been of increasing concern. Here we will explore and analyze the Fires in Brazil data set provided by the Brazilian Government. The data is available here.

Exploring data is commonly the first step in building predictive models in data science. Exploratory data analysis involves summarizing the characteristics of the data set. This includes statistical summaries about features in the data such as mean, standard deviation, distribution, and number of records.

The first step is to import the pandas package in python and read the data into a pandas data frame. You can think of a pandas data frame like a data table or an excel spreadsheet.

import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(“amazon.csv”, encoding = “ISO-8859–1”) print(df.head())

The output of the first five rows is:

As you can see the data includes the year number, Brazilian State, Month, Number of wildfires and the date. We can start our analysis by calculating the mean number of fires for each state. We do this by using the “groupby” method in pandas:

df = df.groupby(‘state’)[‘number’].mean().reset_index() print(df)

We can also visualize this using the ‘seaborn’ package in python:

import seaborn as sns bar = sns.barplot(df['state'], df['number'], color = "red")

bar.set_xticklabels(df['state'], rotation=45)

Mean Number of fires for each state

We can also look at the standard deviation in number of fires for each state:

df = df.groupby(‘state’)[‘number’].mean().reset_index()

bar = sns.barplot(df['state'], df['number'], color = "black")

bar.set_xticklabels(df['state'], rotation=45)

Standard Deviation in Number of fires for each state

We can also look at the distribution in number of fire across all states:
