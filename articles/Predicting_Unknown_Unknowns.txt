For classification models for many domains and scenarios it is important to predict when the input given to the model does not belong to the classes it was trained on.

For computer vision / object detector models author provide following justification:

Object detectors have evolved over time from using feature-based detectors to sliding windows [34], region proposals [32], and, finally, to anchor boxes [31]. The majority of these approaches can be seen as having two parts, the proposal network and the classification network. During training, the classification network includes a background class to identify a proposal as not having an object of interest. However, even for the state-of-the-art systems it has been reported that the object proposals to the classifier “still contain a large proportion of background regions” and “the existence of many background samples makes the feature representation capture less intra-category variance and more inter-category variance (...) causing many false positives between ambiguous object categories” [41]. In a system that both detects and recognizes objects, the ability to handle unknown samples is crucial. Our goal is to improve the ability to classify correct classes while reducing the impact of unknown inputs.

It is also an important problem to tackle in many domains including healthcare, robotics irrespective of vision or NLP.

Nomenclature:

Past approaches to handle this have relied on two fundamental approaches:

Given an input provide uncertainty score based on how close is the input to inputs seen in training. ==> P (U | x) Given an input x predict probability of that input belonging to all classes Ci (i=1 to n) the model was trained on. We then threshold on having a minimum probability for class with highest probability to reject input as out of set or unknown.

Here are summary of some of the related approaches:
