In todayâ€™s article, we are going to use basic Computer Vision techniques to approach the street lanes detection problem which is crucial for self-driving cars. By the end of this article, you will be able to perform real-time lane detection with Python and OpenCV.

Real-Time Lane Detection

Implementation

You can find the full codebase for this project on GitHub and I encourage you to check it and follow along.

Letâ€™s start with defining our problem.

Given an image of the road, we would like to detect street lanes on it.

In order to do it, letâ€™s provide an image path and load it with OpenCV, then letâ€™s invoke find_street_lanes pipeline with it.

test_image = cv2.imread(INPUT_FOLDER + TEST_IMAGE)

street_lanes = find_street_lanes(test_image)

And this is how our find_street_lanes pipeline looks like
