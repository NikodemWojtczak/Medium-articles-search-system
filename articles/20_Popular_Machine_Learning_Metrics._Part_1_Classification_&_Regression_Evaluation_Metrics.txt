Introduction

Choosing the right metric is crucial while evaluating machine learning (ML) models. Various metrics are proposed to evaluate ML models in different applications, and I thought it may be helpful to provide a summary of popular metrics in a here, for better understanding of each metric and the applications they can be used for. In some applications looking at a single metric may not give you the whole picture of the problem you are solving, and you may want to use a subset of the metrics discussed in this post to have a concrete evaluation of your models.

Here, I provide a summary of 20 metrics used for evaluating machine learning models. I group these metrics into different categories based on the ML model/application they are mostly used for, and cover the popular metrics used in the following problems:

Classification Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC, …)

Regression Metrics (MSE, MAE)

Ranking Metrics (MRR, DCG, NDCG)

Statistical Metrics (Correlation)

Computer Vision Metrics (PSNR, SSIM, IoU)

NLP Metrics (Perplexity, BLEU score)

Deep Learning Related Metrics (Inception score, Frechet Inception distance)

There is no need to mention that there are various other metrics used in some applications (FDR, FOR, hit@k, etc.), which I am skipping here.

As a side note, it is also worth mentioning that metric is different from loss function. Loss functions are functions that show a measure of the model performance…
