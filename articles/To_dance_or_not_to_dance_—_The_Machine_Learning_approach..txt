I love dancing! There, I said it. Even though I may not want to dance all the time, I do find myself often scrolling through my playlists in search of my most danceable songs. And here’s the thing, it has nothing to do with genres — at least not for me. But it has everything to do with the music.

How it all started

I had a question: Can I predict whether or not I can dance to a song based on the song’s attributes? So, I set out to find some answers — but before I share my journey with you, let’s discuss some key concepts that will come out throughout the project.

Danceability describes the degree to which a song is good for dancing based on its audio features, e.g. rhythm, tempo, valence. I chose danceability because it is a direct product of the audio features of a song, and therefore an accurate representation of these features — and since I love dancing, I thought it would be a great option to create playlists and make recommendations.

Many songs already have a danceability index associated with them — and we are going to use this data to predict the danceability level of songs that have not been previously classified.

Audio features are features used to characterize audio signals. In this case, these features are key, mode, time signature, acousticness, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo.

And so the journey begins…

Enter Machine Learning

Predictive modeling, as discussed by Jason Brownlee from Machine Learning Mastery, refers to the mathematical problem of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to output variables (y). This is called the problem of function approximation. In other words, we are using historical data to make predictions about new data.

Generally speaking, we could divide most function approximation problems into two major classes: regression and classification. Since I wanted to practice classification algorithms, I decided to set it up as a classification problem.
