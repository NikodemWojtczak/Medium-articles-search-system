Building footprints have always had an aesthetically pleasing quality to them. Visual design often stems for natural and man-made metaphors — two things that are encompassed through the field of cartography. Topological features and waterways present us with soft, curved features which are directly contrasted against the linear and symmetrical shapes of road design.

Here we take the building footprints and plot them to produce a Tron-like image, somewhat resembling a printed circuit board (PCB).

Step 1: Select your location

Personally I find locations which combine rivers with urban areas produce the best results. This is why I opted to use the location of Westminster Boating Base, a small watersports centre in the heart of London, for this task.

Using a quick google maps search it is possible to get the longitude and latitude from the url:

www.google.com/maps/place/51°29'06.6"N+0°08'04.9"W

Step 2: Obtain building shapefiles

There are many sources for getting the shapefiles for buildings in a country. Footprints for the US can be found here, and those in the UK — throuth the Ordnance Survey OpenMap project (link below).

Step 3: Extract only the data which you require

This process involves the use of Python, in combination with the geopandas library pip install geopandas .

We read the file with geopandas.read_file , and then filter out any unwanted results. Since the region we wish to plot includes three different boroughs we extract data only where the NAME column contains one of their names:
