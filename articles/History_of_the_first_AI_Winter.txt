AI has a long history. One can argue it even started long before the term was first coined; mostly in stories and later in actual mechanical devices called automata. This chapter only covers events relevant to the periods of AI winters without being too exhaustive in hope to extract knowledge that can be applied today.

Events leading to the first AI Winter

To aid understanding the phenomenon of AI Winters, the events leading up to them are examined.

Beginnings of the AI Field in the 1950s

Many early ideas about thinking machines appeared in the late 1940s to ’50s by people like Turing or Von Neumann. Turing tried to frame the questions of “Can machines think?” differently and created the imitation game, now famously called the Turing Test.

In 1955, Arthur Samuel wrote a program that could play checkers very well. A year later, it even appeared on television. It used a combination of a tree search with heuristics and learned weights. Samuel handcrafted the heuristics inspired by a book from checkers experts. He used a learning algorithm he called “temporal-difference learning” where the weights are adjusted using the “error” between the score initially calculated and the score after the search was completed.

In 1954, one of the first experiments in machine translation was executed. It used a 250-word dictionary for translation combined with syntactical analysis. Translations between English and Russian were demonstrated. The New York Times commented:

“This admittedly will amount to a crude word-for-word translation … but will nevertheless be extremely valuable, the designers say, for such purposes as scientists translations of foreign technical papers in which vocabulary is far more of a problem than syntax .”

By then, the designers thought that most of the work was done with only some small errors to fix. Hutchin noted that it was the most far-reaching coverage that machine translation has ever received. For this reason, it generated tremendous hype and made it easier to…
