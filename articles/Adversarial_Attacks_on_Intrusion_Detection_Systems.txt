Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in a very short period of time. Alan Turing, a pioneer computer scientist, published the first paper on the possibility of machines that can think in 1950. In less than a century, humans have created machines and programs that can compute and comprehend very large amounts of data to learn and mimic the acts of humans themselves.

People, businesses, and governments rely heavily on this newfound technology without even realizing it. One growing sector of AI is security. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are systems used to protect networks or systems from malicious traffic. AI is dynamic by nature with its ability to learn, so it would be ideal for this application so that it can learn and evolve. This makes AI good at detecting good and malicious internet traffic as it doesnâ€™t follow a defined set of rules but instead dynamically creates its own.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a big role in protecting this information saved in a network or system, and AI is being integrated into IDS due to their low maintenance and ability to stay up to date with the latest attacks. Due to the rapid developments in AI, the need to increase the robustness of these systems have been neglected, and current research looks into ways of improving IDS.
