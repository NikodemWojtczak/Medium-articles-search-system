“Look at the data — the numbers don’t lie.” It’s an often given piece of advice, but a less often understood one. Because what the person giving the advice really means is “Look at the data, and think about what it means for the situation we’re facing. Once you consider it in the broader context, you’ll see — and intuitively know — what to do next.” That’s a very different challenge to meet, but an infinitely more valuable one when you’re trying to make sense of a complex situation. And it’s possible only when you realise that connecting your data is even more important than collecting it.

Why Collection is no Longer Enough

Data collection is now mainstream. Storage is cheap, source are abundant and most products being built today are done so with the expectation that organisations will want access to their data in ways outside of the product’s offerings, via bulk export or automated delivery. Despite this helpful (and rapidly becoming expected) type of access, most data is still viewed within the single perspective that it was collected. Sure — graphs, charts and dashboards are possible and certainly helpful, but they’re often created using data that’s already been actioned, and usually to just re-tell the same story that’s already been told. The innovation factor is low, because the connection factor is also low.

But apart from these technical considerations, there is another more fundamental reason why disconnected data isn’t as helpful as it could be. Human beings are evolutionary creatures, and at our most basic level we are instinctively wired to consider the entirety of a situation before responding to it. Early human tribes didn’t seek out short-term gain if it compromised their chances of long-term survival (though it could be argued that the modern world has reduced our ability for this type of thinking) because to do so would contradict our unique awareness for considering relationships in our environment. The same holds true for data collected from technical systems — a broader context is lacking by default, and context is key to understanding.

What Connection Makes Possible

Data is enriched through connection, which offers a far more realistic representation of complex environments. When we look at data that is connected through a relevant framework, we engage the part of our mind that understands consequences, dependencies and how the quality of relationships affect the outcome we are seeking.

The argument is sometimes made that this type of thinking is still possible with disconnected data, it just requires us to put the pieces together in our head. This is the same argument that says human beings can multitask, but multiple studies have confirmed that we don’t — rather, we single-task with quick switching. This switching comes at a mental cost though, which can lead to poor outcomes through reluctance to gather all of the disconnected pieces every time a decision needs to be made.

Connecting data into a seamless, holistic perspective removes the need for switching. It enables us to understand the contributing factors of an event and act appropriately. Over time, this heightened awareness leads to the development of new knowledge, which if delivered back into the framework creates a unique feedback loop whereby insight gives rise to further insight. As knowledge is shared, unexpected opportunities for collaboration emerge. The innovation factor rises in response to the rising connection.

Connection is Always Relevant — Especially When Humans Are Involved

Understanding how to connect data in an organisation can sometimes be difficult. Over time people tend to specialise in a given area, and that specialisation can lead to the belief that one type of data has limited relevance to another. But if looked at closely, these same areas will usually be found to have unseen ties and concerns to others. Connecting the data of all areas in an organisation helps to generate a wider context that speaks to our evolutionary understanding of nature and our place in it, where no one entity truly exists in isolation.

This is even more true for organisations that work with human networks. We are deeply connected beings, with our behaviours often influenced far more by those around us (and even those around them) than we believe. These social ties often vary in type and strength, both of which affect the flow of influence and change. Proper consideration of these diverse relationships is fundamental to making informed decisions, and only possible when data is properly connected.
