If you would like to plot map graphs using geographical coordinates from your address data, Google provides an API called Geocoding that lets you convert addresses to geographical coordinates and vice versa.

What is Geocoding?

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like “1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA”) into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. Read more here if you would like to dig deeper.

Google Cloud Geocoding API Pricing:

Google offers $200 free credit per month for this API (based on the type of account you have), so please make sure you understand the cost that may be incurred while running this API for yourself.

Let’s get started

I used Jupyter notebook to run the script in this tutorial.

First, you will want to import the GoogleMaps and Pandas packages. If you haven’t already, make sure these packages have been installed into your environment with pip.

from googlemaps import Client as GoogleMaps

import pandas as pd

Creating Your API Key

Now, you will need to create an API key from the Credentials Section in your Google Cloud Platform account. It’s pretty straight forward.

Type API & Services in your console search bar.

in your console search bar. Click on ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES

Search for Geocoding API and make sure it is enabled

and make sure it is enabled Now click on Credentials > Create Credentials and create a new API key

You will use this API key when creating a new GoogleMaps object in Python.

Now back in Jupyter notebook, create a GoogleMaps object using the API key you just…
