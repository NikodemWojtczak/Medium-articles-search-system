This is the second post of a series I’m writing about dialogues from my company’s internal Slack group. You can check out the first one here.

If you’re joining us now, we run a private Slack group that’s half experienced data scientists, and half aspiring data scientists. The aspiring half tends to ask great questions, and the experienced half tends to give great answers.

The question we’ll look at today is: When you’re actively job hunting, how should you divide your time between the job hunt itself— applying, interviewing, networking — and keeping your technical skills sharp?

This question comes up a lot. It’s very hard to balance both! Luckily, there are great tactics to make this easier which you’ll find in today’s conversation.
