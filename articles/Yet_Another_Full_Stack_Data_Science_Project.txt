Introduction

I came across the term “Full Stack Data Science” for the first time a couple of years back when I was searching for Data Science meetups in Washington D.C. region.

Coming from a software development background, I am quite familiar with the term Full Stack Developer, but Full Stack Data Science sounded mystical.

With more and more companies incorporating Data Science & Machine Learning in their traditional software applications, the term Full Stack Data Science makes more sense now than at any point in history.

Software development methodologies are meticulously developed over the years to ensure high-quality software applications in low turn around time. Unfortunately, traditional software development methodologies do not work well in the context of Data Science applications.

In this blog post, I am going to emphasize on Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) to develop a viable full stack Data Science product.

I firmly believe in the proverb, “the proof of the pudding is in the eating.” so I have implemented Starbucks challenge by applying CRISP-DM methodology as a sister project for this post, and is referred at multiple places in this blog post.
