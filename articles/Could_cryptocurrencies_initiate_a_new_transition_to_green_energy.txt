Could cryptocurrencies initiate a new transition to green energy?

Bitcoin, Ether and other alt-corners are multiplying around the world and are now part of our daily lives. To date, crypto-currencies could well initiate a change, favouring renewable energies. Stephane Bilodeau · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 2 min read · Sep 18, 2019 -- 2 Share

The blockchain model is becoming more responsible and relies entirely on the potential of the decentralized system. Some experts would be more formal: blockchains could play an important role in the distribution of the alternative energies, just as in the evolution of the public service. Great options are given by a combination of the Blockchain and/or Cryptocurrencies with clean technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Renewables and Hybrid Energy Storage, notably, exploiting the waste energy recovery and conversion of heat generated by the datacenters' operation to provide a source of energy.

But others are thinking otherwise. Indeed, the Bitcoin network has a problem of energy consumption. It consumes a lot of energy despite processing in order of magnitude ot 100 million financial transactions a year. A figure to compare to that of the conventional financial industry, which processes 500 billion transactions per year. And if we consider the amount of energy used by datacenters, Bitcoin consumes much more energy per transaction than all the banks in the world combined.

So, this is still an unsolved question. What do you think about it?
