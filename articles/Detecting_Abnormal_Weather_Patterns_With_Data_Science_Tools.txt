Around the world, extreme weather events are becoming more intense and frequent.

There’s no missing some of these major weather abnormalities, such as flash floods or prolonged droughts, which can affect large swathes of a country’s population.

But not every weather outlier can be easily observed, particularly in Singapore where the seasonal changes are less obvious to the naked eye. Yet, these “milder” anomalies could be just as important in understanding future changes in the weather pattern.

Data visualisation, such as the range of charts in my earlier Medium post on the subject, provide a quick way to spot such outliers in a dataset. The classic Seaborn pair plot is one way to do this.

But when you have 36 years of weather data, it won’t be easy or efficient to rely on charts to accurately pick out the outliers.

In this third of a multi-part data science project using historical weather data from Singapore, I’ll use Scikit-learn’s Isolation Forest model as well as the PyOD library (Python Outlier Detection) to try to pinpoint outliers in the dataset.

It will be interesting to see the precise dates where these abnormal weather patterns took place. This is also important pre-work for Part IV of the project — time series forecasting, where removal of the outliers would be key to more accurate predictions.

DATA AND REPO

The original source of the weather data in this project can be found here. The Jupyter notebook for this post is here, and you can download the interactive Plotly charts here to explore the outlier data in greater detail.

OVERVIEW OF RESULTS

For the benefit of those who might have no interest in plowing through the detailed data workflow, I’ll start with a quick overview of the results.
