PyCon JP 2019 is held in 2019/9/16~ 2019/9/17 for two days. This post is about one talk on the second day.

Takashi Morioka is the CEO of the dating App Dine. His talk mainly focuses on his development experiences for the matching optimization. The data processing is under Google Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam Python SDK) and the ML part is done by Cloud ML Engine. Slides are here.

Background

The goal of a dating app is to match two users. The main matching approaches have two methods, the searching method, and the recommendation method.

Searching method: User search by their preference

Recommendation method: The dating site will recommend the candidate for user

Takashi Morioka told Dine mainly uses the recommendation method.

To solve the stable marriage problem, Dine uses the Gale–Shapley algorithm. But this algorithm has a big problem, the computing cost is huge.

Reduce the computing cost

See we have total N users. We first calculate the score from use A against other N-1 users. Then, we rank N users and recommend for user A. The runtime will be O(N² log N).

To reduce the computing cost, Dine split users into different groups (the speaker doesn’t mention the split standard). The advantages of grouping are it can reduce the user number from N to group numbers and calculate the score parallel.

But still, there are two problems.
