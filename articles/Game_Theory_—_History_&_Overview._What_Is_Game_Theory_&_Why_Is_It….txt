Life is survival & survival is competition. Whenever two or more entities are faced with constraints, such as a fixed amount of resources, in a win/lose scenario, competition emerges. It’s inevitable & natural. It’s evolutionary as evident by food-chain balances in ecosystems — of course, this innate behavior extends equally to humans. From competition, in any of its many forms, stems strategy.

Game theory is the branch of applied math used to create an optimum strategy in order to succeed in competitive situations of uncertainty & incomplete knowledge (like most real-life scenarios). It’s the mathematical study of decision making & modeling in situations of conflict that are found in everyday life across all industries & disciplines.

Countries go to war for territory, businesses compete for market share, animals fight for resources, & political parties vie for votes. In a world ruled by interdependent agents aiming to increase their “value” in dynamic systems, game theory is monumentally germane.

While the academic discipline & the field itself was only formally established in the 1950s, game theory-like insights are clearly visible in centuries-old history. Below, we’ll review both the background of the ancient days & the forward acceleration of the 1950s .

The Ancient Days

Clear in hindsight, the ideas underlying game theory appear multiple times throughout history. From the war-musings of Sun Tzu to the evolutionary discoveries of Charles Darwin, it has long existed as a driving force of human behavior. The basis of ancient game theory, however, is usually attributed to the popularity of the following three specific works:
