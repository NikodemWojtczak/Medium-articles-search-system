Introduction

Part 1 — Example Areas in Data Science and Key Traits of a Troubleshooter

Part 2 — Steps in Data Science Troubleshooting & How to Develop the Skills

In Part 1 of this two-part series, we looked at areas of data science where troubleshooting is often needed, along with my list of key traits of a data science troubleshooter. Please check out Part 1 if you haven’t read it yet, because a lot of what I say in Part 2 references things in Part 1. Or, to say it another way, as we hear in the first track of side 2 of the vinyl LP soundtrack to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, “This is Side Two!
