The art of being a software engineer is a continuous process of refinement over successive iteration. This article is intended for those of you just starting out, those of you who are curious, or those of you who are deciding to skill up, take the plunge, and dive into the surprising world of software!

Learning how to code is a continual process, you never stop. It’s an upward spiral. Emphasis on the spiral.

You don’t just study it for 12 weeks, 6 months, or 2–4 years and then you’re just “done.” You’re continually growing. Now, I’ve been on a mission to emulate the human brain in machines since I was 7. Of course, I can’t do this alone. We need to build an army of like-minded, hybrid technologists who are actively seeking to understand both the human brain and how machines compute information. One small step in this greater scheme is guiding my fellow builders, tinkerers, and dreamers to become better at their own craft as software engineers.

Here are my top 5 tips that will help you become a better software engineer.

Learn How to Use Data Structures and Algorithms

It’s more than knowing what they are, it’s also knowing how to use them, why you use them, and what are the trade offs of one approach versus the other. For example, what is the difference between a linked list and an array? What are the advantages of binary search and when do you use it? Do you know how to recognize when a real world issue can be mapped as a dynamic programming problem, like the famous 0–1 knapsack problem, or the longest common subsequence?
