Visualizing Beta Distribution and Bayesian Updating

Beta distribution is one of the more esoteric distributions compared to Bernoulli, Binomial and Geometric distributions. It is also rare in practice because it does not have a readily available real-world analogy that helps intuition. To make matters worse, online tutorials tend to intimidate readers with complex formula (beta & gamma functions) and weird sounding names (conjugate prior). So in this post, I’ll waive those technical details and supplement some badly needed intuition through visual animations and simulated experiments.

Introduction

Beta distribution is a probability distribution of probabilities. What does it mean? Everyone started learning probability by flipping a coin. So let’s start with a coin. First, define p as the probability of landing a head. If the coin is fair, then it is most likely that the coin will land head half of the time. In this case, p = 50% is the most likely value for p. But wait, it is also possible to have an unfair coin that behaves accidentally like a fair coin. So we cannot rule out the possibility that the coin is unfair, even if we observe heads half of the time.

Notice how I am using probability to describe probability p. This is the essence of Beta distribution: it describes how likely p can take on each value between 0 and 1. Beta distribution is parametrized by Beta(𝛼, 𝛽). Together 𝛼 and 𝛽 describe the probability that p takes on a certain value. Here is the only formula you’ll need to get through this post.

Prior

Prior is what we believe before conducting an experiment. If you look at both sides of a coin and see that one side is head and the other side is tail, you may believe that the coin is a fair one. A fair coin has 𝛼 = 𝛽, and the magnitude describes how…
