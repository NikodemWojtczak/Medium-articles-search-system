Introduction

This article presents the different data types in R. To learn about the different variable types from a statistical point of view, read “Variable types and examples”.

What data types exist in R?

There are the 6 most common data types in R:

Numeric Integer Complex Character Factor Logical

Datasets in R are often a combination of these 6 different data types. Below we explore in more detail each data types one by one, except the data type “complex” as we focus on the main ones and this data type is rarely used in practice.

Numeric

The most common data type in R is numeric. A variable or a series will be stored as numeric data if the values are numbers or if the values contains decimals. For example, the following two series are stored as numeric by default:

# numeric series without decimals

num_data <- c(3, 7, 2)

num_data ## [1] 3 7 2 class(num_data) ## [1] "numeric" # numeric series with decimals

num_data_dec <- c(3.4, 7.1, 2.9)

num_data_dec ## [1] 3.4 7.1 2.9 class(num_data_dec) ## [1] "numeric" # also possible to check the class thanks to str()

str(num_data_dec) ## num [1:3] 3.4 7.1 2.9

In other words, if you assign one or several numbers to an object in R, it will be stored as numeric by default (numbers with decimals), unless specified otherwise.

Integer

An integer data type is actually a special case of numeric data. Integers are numeric data without decimals. This can be used if you are sure that the numbers you store will never contain decimals. For example, let’s say you are interested in the number of children in a sample of 10 families. This variable is a discrete variable (see a reminder on the variable types if you do…
