Hey Alexa, Tell Me a Joke!

I don’t remember what her response was, but I do remember being so excited with the new device that I posted an AMA (which is an acronym for Ask Me Anything) on Reddit. The headline was: I just got Alexa, type in what you want me to ask her!

For the next day, Redditors would send me questions to ask, I’d ask Alexa, and I’d reply to those Redditors with her response. Some of them might’ve been Alexa engineers themselves; they asked questions that gave Easter Egg answers, sort of like ordering from a secret menu (if you have Alexa, try asking her: Alexa, who is the fairest of them all?). That day, I also earned the highest amount of Karma I’d ever earned on Reddit (Karma is a points system on Reddit that is equivalent to likes on Facebook or Twitter). Thanks, Alexa.

Before long, I was purchasing smart bulbs and smart outlets, all switched on and off by Alexa and thus, via the transitive property (if A=B and B=C, then A=C), my voice. It was just too convenient compared to finding your phone, unlocking it, opening up the smart bulb app, and then manually adjusting lighting with your fingers. And while Alexa was already convenient throughout my home, she was even better in bed— I no longer needed to get up to turn off the lights before going to sleep.
