1. Student Assessment Data

Assessment data is the common data source for teachers to determine their students’ understanding of the material they learned. These can be used to get pulse reads on concepts (through quizzes and exit tickets) or a student’s overall understanding of a unit or more (unit tests, midterms, finals).

The ideal use of these assessments is for teachers to take the results and modify their strategies for future lessons. This includes revisiting material they struggled with and perhaps forming optimal groups so peers can teach each other the respective topics they struggled with. This process is, however, time-consuming by itself in addition to the time spent just to grade these assessments.

There are tools such as ZipGrade for multiple-choice assessments to speed up this process and provide quick summary insights and item analysis. But it doesn’t answer questions such as:

A) What percentage of my students earned more than half credit on that evolution short response question?

B) How many of my students answered the question on finding inverses graphically but struggled with the question on finding inverses algebraically?

C) How can I quickly create groups of students for a review lesson based on the assessment data to answer question B?

The answer to question A can be done using an ECDF chart. If you are not familiar with this type of chart you can read my article on it below.

For question B, a bubble chart can be used to compare points data on two questions to see how many students performed well in both questions, performed well on one question, or performed well in neither. You can read more about bubble charts here.

For question C, we can use unsupervised machine learning to help with this. I already built a web app solution for this. I will share that with you in a future article ;).
