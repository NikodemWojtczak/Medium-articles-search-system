Member-only story Math for Data Science: Collaborative Filtering on Utility Matrices

I highly recommend checking out one of my other posts as an introduction to recommendation engines:

Recap: What is Collaborative Filtering?

Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation engine that uses both user and item data. More specifically, ratings from individual users on individual items. This way, items are recommended based on the ratings from other users, thus, collaborative. This data can be represented in a utility matrix, with one axis being users and one axis being items. The goal of collaborative filtering recommendation engines is to fill in the gaps in a utility matrix since not every user has rated every item, and then output the top-rated, previously-unrated items as recommendations.

A simple utility matrix, with 4 users (columns) and 4 items (rows).

There are three main techniques to fill in the utility matrix: user-user, item-item and SVD. We’ll run through each of these using our simple utility matrix above to try and predict what User 1 would rate Item 3.

User to User

There are two main steps in computing the missing value of our utility matrix:

Compute the similarity between U1 and all other users Compute U1’s rating for I3 by taking an average of other users’ I3 ratings, weighting each user’s rating by the user’s similarity to U1
