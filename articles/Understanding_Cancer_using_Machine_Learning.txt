Introduction

As demonstrated by many researchers [1, 2], the use of Machine Learning (ML) in Medicine is nowadays becoming more and more important. Researchers are now using ML in applications such as EEG analysis and Cancer Detection/Analysis. For example, by examining biological data such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing can then be possible to infer which genes can cause cancer and which genes can instead be able to suppress its expression. In this post, I will walk you through how I examined 9 different datasets about TCGA Liver, Cervical and Colon Cancer. All the datasets have been provided by the UCSC Xena (University of California, Santa Cruz website). For each of the 3 different types of cancer considered, three datasets were used, containing information about DNA methylation (Methylation450k), gene expression RNAseq (IlluminaHiSeq) and finally exon expression RNAseq (IlluminaHiSeq). These datasets are then grouped by information type rather than by cancer. I decided to use these datasets because they had all their features in common and shared a similar number of samples. Furthermore, I decided to select these types of cancers, because they offered a varied view of the genes and chromosomes characteristics of the human body since the different cancers were located in different parts of the body. In this way, the classification results obtained in this exercise could be generalised to other forms of cancer. DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, and its…
