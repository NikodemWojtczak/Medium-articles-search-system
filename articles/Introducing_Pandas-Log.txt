Introducing Pandas-Log

The pandas ecosystem has been invaluable for the data science ecosystem, and thus today most data science tasks consist of series of pandas’ steps to transform raw data into an understandable/usable format.

These steps’ accuracy is crucial, and thus understanding the unexpected results becomes crucial as well. Unfortunately, the ecosystem lacks the tools to understand those unexpected results.

That’s why I created Pandas-log, it provides metadata on each operation which will allow pinpointing the issues. For example, after .query it returns the number of rows being filtered.

As always I believe its easier to understand with an example so I will use the pokemon dataset to find “who is the weakest non-legendary fire pokemon?”.
