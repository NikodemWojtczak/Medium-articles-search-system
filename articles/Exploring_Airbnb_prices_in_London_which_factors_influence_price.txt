Project aims and background

Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts set their own prices for their listings, and although Airbnb and other sites provide some general guidance, there are currently no free and accurate services which help hosts price their properties using a wide range of data points.

It’s really important to get pricing right on Airbnb, especially in big cities like London where there is a lot of competition. I recently conducted a project to use machine learning and deep learning to predict the price for Airbnb properties in London. I’ve explored the preparation and cleaning of Airbnb data in a previous post, and in a future post I’ll explore the modelling. But this post is all about exploring the listing data to extract interesting and useful insights, in order to help hosts maximise their earnings.

Additional context: I previously worked for a year and a half at an Airbnb property management company, as head of the team responsible for pricing, revenue and analysis. Decisions made during the course of this project are therefore informed by domain expertise in this industry.

The dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from Insideairbnb.com, an anti-Airbnb lobby group that scrapes Airbnb listings, reviews and calendar data from multiple cities around the world. The dataset was scraped on 9 April 2019 and contains information on all London Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date (about 80,000). A GeoJSON file of London borough boundaries was also downloaded from the same site.

The data is quite messy, and has some limitations. The major one is that it only includes the advertised price (sometimes called the ‘sticker’ price). The sticker price is the overall nightly price that is advertised to potential…
