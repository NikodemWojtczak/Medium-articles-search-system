The romantic side of data science: Analyzing a relationship through a year worth of text messages Guy Tsror · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 11 min read · Apr 1, 2019 -- 1 Share

This was supposed to be a private project, one I thought I would upload to a private Google Colab notebook, and share with just whomever it is relevant for (which is, one other person, referred to here as “OJ”). But then, a lightbulb —why not clean it up and share with others as well?

Basically, to celebrate our first anniversary of dating, I decided to explore our relationship from the communication point of view, and look at our messaging behaviors: what are we saying to each other, when are we saying it, how do we respond to each other, and so on. I would include call logs in it, but I actually never tracked that (shame on me!) so I had to let it go, especially since we mostly have up to two phone calls a week, making it a bit less interesting.

So — I will go through my thought process to those who are interested in what I did and why, and towards the end, I will share some links and tools that came in handy during the process. I am working on improving my Python skills as I go, so you could also find there some Python-related snippets that were handy.

Methodology

The key communication channel we use is WhatsApp. We do SMS-text occasionally, but it’s negligible, and the occasional Messenger link or YouTube message are very rare, so I chose to stick to WhatsApp to simplify the process.
