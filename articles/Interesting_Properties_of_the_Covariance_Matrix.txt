Interesting Properties of the Covariance Matrix

The covariance matrix has many interesting properties, and it can be found in mixture models, component analysis, Kalman filters, and more. Developing an intuition for how the covariance matrix operates is useful in understanding its practical implications. This article will focus on a few important properties, associated proofs, and then some interesting practical applications, i.e., non-Gaussian mixture models.

I have often found that research papers do not specify the matrices’ shapes when writing formulas. I have included this and other essential information to help data scientists code their own algorithms.

Sub-Covariance Matrices

The covariance matrix can be decomposed into multiple unique (2x2) covariance matrices. The number of unique sub-covariance matrices is equal to the number of elements in the lower half of the matrix, excluding the main diagonal. A (DxD) covariance matrices will have D*(D+1)/2 -D unique sub-covariance matrices. For example, a three dimensional covariance matrix is shown in equation (0).

It can be seen that each element in the covariance matrix is represented by the covariance between each (i,j) dimension pair. Equation (1), shows the decomposition of a (DxD) into multiple (2x2) covariance matrices. For the (3x3) dimensional case, there will be 3*4/2–3, or 3, unique sub-covariance matrices.

Note that generating random sub-covariance matrices might not result in a valid covariance matrix. The covariance matrix must be positive semi-definite and the variance for each diagonal element of the sub-covariance matrix must the same as the variance across the diagonal of the covariance matrix.

Positive Semi-Definite Property

One of the covariance matrix’s properties is that it must be a positive semi-definite matrix. What positive definite means and why the covariance matrix is always positive semi-definite merits a separate…
