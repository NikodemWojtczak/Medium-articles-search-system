Review: SqueezeNet (Image Classification)

In this story, SqueezeNet, by DeepScale, UC Berkeley and Stanford University, is reviewed. With equivalent accuracy, smaller CNN architectures offer at least three advantages

Smaller Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require less communication across servers during distributed training. Smaller CNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. Smaller CNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory.
