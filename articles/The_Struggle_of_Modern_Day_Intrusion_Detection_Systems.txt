There are four cases when traffic attempts to pass through an IDS. The first two cases are normal traffic passing through and malicious traffic being rejected, but there are two cases where traffic can be misclassified. A false positive is when good traffic is considered malicious and rejected before entering the system, and a false negative is when malicious traffic is considered good and is allowed into the system, where positive is assumed to be malicious and negative is assumed to be normal. Adversarial AI focuses on these last two cases; by fooling the system, the adversarial AI system can choose which traffic can enter and which can be rejected.

IDSâ€™s and adversarial AI are two major players fighting to outsmart the other, and the potential for both of these are essentially limitless. That being said, I look forward to seeing how adversarial AI will affect the development of not only IDS but AI as a whole.
