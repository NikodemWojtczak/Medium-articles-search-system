In this post, we will analyze Twitter tweets related to the Joker (2019 film). To get started you need to apply for a Twitter developer account:

After your developer account has been approved you need to create a Twitter application:

The steps for applying for a Twitter developer account and creating a Twitter application are outlined here.

We will be using the free python library tweepy in order to access the Twitter API. Documentation for tweepy can be found here.

INSTALLATION

First, make sure you have tweepy installed. Open up a command line and type:

pip install tweepy

2. IMPORT LIBRARIES

Next, open up your favorite editor and import the tweepy and pandas libraries:

import tweepy

import pandas as pdAUTHENTICATION

Next we need our consumer key and access token:

Notice that the site suggests that you keep your key and token private! Here we define a fake key and token but you should use your real key and token upon creating the Twitter application as shown above:

consumer_key = '5GBi0dCerYpy2jJtkkU3UwqYtgJpRd'

consumer_secret = 'Q88B4BDDAX0dCerYy2jJtkkU3UpwqY'

access_token = 'X0dCerYpwi0dCerYpwy2jJtkkU3U'

access_token_secret = 'kly2pwi0dCerYpjJtdCerYkkU3Um'

The next step is creating an OAuthHandler instance. We pass our consumer key and access token which we defined above:

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)

auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

Next, we pass the OAuthHandler instance into the API method:
