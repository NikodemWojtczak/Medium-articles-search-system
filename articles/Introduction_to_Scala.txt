Strings

In Scala we can work with strings in a very similar way that we do in Python. A common use of strings is interpolation, which means to inject a phrase or sentence with a remark or word. A string interpolation looks like this:

s"Hello, $firstName $lastName" res0: String = Hello, John Doe

Similarly to how Python uses the f string, here we are using s. The double quotes are important in Scala as it will return an error if we try to pass single quotes. Scala uses the $ to preface the variable being passed into the interpolation. Notice how it automatically adds the space between the words:

s"Hello, ${firstName + lastName}" res1: String = Hello, JohnDoe

There is no separation between the first and last name in the method above. To get the space we would have to be explicit using: ${firstName + " " + lastName}" . I prefer using the $ for each variable without {} — you can use either method for interpolation.

String Indexing

Probably the most used techniques in Data Science are indexing and using ranges. In both cases, Scala uses the .slice() method, where the first number is inclusive while the last number is exclusive. Let’s work on some examples.

First I created a new variable called “fullName”.

val fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

In Scala, we can call the first index of our variable by simply using () after the variable.

fullName(0) this will return J in our fullName variable. For indexing a range of indices within our variable, we need to call .slice() and pass in the range of indices.
